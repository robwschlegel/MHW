Abstract
A changing global climate places shallow water ecosystems at more risk than those in the open ocean as
their temperatures may change more rapidly and dramatically. To this end, it is necessary to identify the
occurrence of extreme ocean temperature events — marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold-spells
(MCSs) — in the nearshore environment as they can be ecologically damaging. The occurrence of
MHWs have been investigated in three global regions, but no investigations of MCSs have yet to be
carried out. Neither events have had the physical phenomena contributing to their development well
studied. A recently developed framework that defines these events in a novel way was applied to ocean
temperature time series from i) a nearshore in situ dataset and ii) 1⁄4° NOAA Optimally Interpolated
sea surface temperatures. Regional drivers due to nearshore influences (local-scale) and the forcing of
two offshore ocean currents (broad-scale) on MHWs and MCSs were investigated. The events detected
in these two datasets were used to infer the impact offshore temperatures may be having on the
nearshore thermal regime in time and space, and vice versa. We show that MHWs and MCSs occur at
least once a year on average but that proportions of co-occurrence of events between the broad- and
local scale are low (0.20-0.50), with MHWs having greater proportions of co-occurrence than MCSs.
Significant differences in the duration and intensity of events between different coastal sections may be
attributed to the effects of the interaction of oceanographic processes offshore, as well as with local
features of the coast. The regional decadal trends in MHWs and MCSs in the offshore dataset show
that MHWs are increasing while MCSs are decreasing. This study represents an important first step in
the analysis of the dynamics of extreme events in nearshore environments, and their relationship with
broad-scale influences. The low co-occurrence of events between the nearshore and offshore datasets
show that the mesoscale ocean temperatures are likely not the main driver affecting nearshore events.

Although climate change is generally understood as a gradual long-term rise in global mean surface
5

temperature (Stocker et al., 2013), which will continue for decades or centuries, it is generally the
associated increase in frequency and severity of extreme events that affects humans and ecosystems
in the short-term (Easterling et al., 2000). Impacts of extreme events such as floods, wind storms,
tropical cyclones, heatwaves and cold-spells are often sudden with catastrophic consequences. The
recognition to focus more on the extremes and less on the background mean state has emerged as a

10

critical direction of climate change research (Jentsch et al., 2007).
‘Heatwaves’ usually refer to atmospheric phenomena where vague definitions such as “a period of
abnormally and uncomfortably hot [...] weather” are invoked (Glickman, 2000), but there are also
precise definitions based on statistical properties and other metrics of the temperature record that are
relative to location and time of year (e.g. Meehl, 2004; Alexander et al., 2006; Fischer and Schär, 2010;

15

Fischer et al., 2011; Perkins and Alexander, 2013). As the definitions for heatwaves have increased,
so to have the investigations of heatwaves in the ocean (e.g. Mackenzie and Schiedek, 2007; Selig
et al., 2010; Sura, 2011; Lima and Wethey, 2012; DeCastro et al., 2014). Well-known marine heatwaves
(MHWs) have occurred in the Mediterranean in 2003 (Black et al., 2004; Olita et al., 2007; Garrabou
et al., 2009), off the coast of Western Australia in 2011 (Feng et al., 2013; Pearce and Feng, 2013;

20

Wernberg et al., 2013), in the north west Atlantic Ocean in 2012 (Mills et al., 2012; Chen et al.,
2014, 2015) and more recently the “Blob” in the north east Pacific Ocean (Bond et al., 2015). The
extreme temperatures from these events have had negative impacts on the local ecology of the regions
in which they occur. For example, the 2003 Mediterranean heatwave may have affected up to 80% of
the gorgonian fan colonies in some areas (Garrabou et al., 2009), and the 2011 event off the west coast

25

of Australia is now known to have caused substantial loss of temperate seaweeds and a tropicalisation
of reef fishes (Wernberg et al., 2013).
Although the consequences of these anomalously warm events have been widely publicised, the
events themselves have until recently not been objectively characterised. In part, this has been due to
the lack of a consistent definition and metrics. In response to this need, Hobday et al. (2016) developed

30

a definition of a MHW as “a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described
by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent,” and in doing so have derived statistical
metrics that quantify these properties. For example, the count of MHWs within a time series and their
maximum and cumulative intensity are quantifiable parameters that can be calculated in a consistent
manner irrespective of geographical location. The focus of this paper is on marine thermal events that

35

are extreme with respect to the seasonal climatology as per the Hobday et al. (2016) definition. They
may be anomalously warm events, or anomalously cold (marine cold-spells, MCSs; introduced here).
While MHWs are becoming reasonably well known by virtue of their increasing count and intensity,
MCSs have received less recognition. Whereas extreme hot events may be demonstrably damaging to
organisms and ecosystems, extreme cold events also have the potential to negatively impact organisms

40

and ecosystems (Lirman et al., 2011). In both cases their drivers and dynamics, particularly in the
coastal zone, remain poorly understood.

2

MCSs are projected to become less frequent under future climatic scenarios, but there are also
examples of them becoming more frequent in some localities (e.g. Gershunov and Douville, 2008;
Matthes et al., 2015). They are frequently lethal (Woodward, 1987) and are known to have caused
45

mass fish (Gunter, 1941, 1951; Holt and Holt, 1983) and invertebrate (Gunter, 1951; Crisp, 1964) kills,
the death of juvenile and sub-adult manatees (O’Shea et al., 1985; Marsh et al., 1986) and even coral
bleaching (Lirman et al., 2011). Cold temperatures are very important in setting species population
distribution limits, particularly limiting their range north- or southwards towards higher latitudes
(Firth et al., 2011), and the timing of the onset of growing seasons (Jentsch et al., 2007). It is easy

50

to postulate how population-level consequences might aggregate to drive whole ecosystem responses
(e.g. Kreyling et al., 2008; Rehage et al., 2016). Indeed, the range contractions of ecosystem engineer
species such as mussels have been shown to relate to MCSs (Firth et al., 2011, 2015).
Although we understand that the sea surface temperature (SST) of the upper mixed layer is
influenced by oceanic and atmospheric processes (see Equation 1 of Deser et al., 2010), there is

55

by no means a good understanding of how these processes are modulated by local- vs. broad-scale
influences, thus resulting in coastal MHWs (MCSs). Such studies have not yet been undertaken to
the best of our knowledge. Some of the MCSs known to have impacted populations were caused by
atmospheric cold-spells affecting the intertidal and coastal biota locally (Gunter, 1941; Firth et al.,
2011). We hypothesise that these localised events are manifestations of extreme atmospheric cold

60

weather phenomena situated over the coast resulting in rapid heat loss from coastal waters. On the
other hand, we think that broader-scale teleconnections may also affect the thermal properties and
dynamics of coastal systems. For example, large-scale atmospheric-oceanographic coupling is being
affected by global warming, which is projected to cause the intensification of upwelling favourable winds
and consequently the intensification and increasing count of upwelling events (see García-Reyes et al.,

65

2015, for a review of this and alternative hypotheses). It is therefore possible that the development of
some coastal MCSs may be attributed to an intensification of upwelling. MHWs at any scale likely
originate directly from atmosphere-ocean heat transfer as in the Mediterranean Sea (e.g. Garrabou
et al., 2009) or from advection, i.e., the transport of warm water due to currents such as what happened
off Western Australia in 2011 (Feng et al., 2013; Benthuysen et al., 2014), the NW Atlantic in 2012

70

(Mills et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014, 2015) and potentially off SE Australia in 2016. Since MHWs and
MCSs are both able to effect ecosystem change, a mechanistic understanding of their drivers will be
invaluable. To this end our study serves as a constructive first step to understand the prevalence of
anomalous thermal events with respect to forcing mechanisms at different scales.
Hobday et al. (2016) applied their MHW framework to the 1⁄4° NOAA optimally interpolated SST

75

dataset (hereafter referred to as OISST; Reynolds et al., 2007), but warned users to be cognisant that
different data sets would provide different kinds of information pertaining to heatwaves. Our study
applied this MHW (MCS) definition to datasets of coastal in situ (local-scale) and offshore gridded
OISST (broad-scale) temperature time series collected at different locations along coastlines influenced
by contrasting ocean currents — the Benguela Current, an eastern boundary upwelling system, and the

3

80

Agulhas Current — and locally modified by regional aspects of the coastal bathymetry, geomorphology
and other smaller scale coastal features. Having assessed these systems within a framework that
coupled local- and broad-scale features permitted us to assess how MHWs (MCSs) developed in coastal
regions. Specifically, we aimed to assess the significance of MHWs (MCSs) within the context of
the datasets’ inherent differences, and examine the various dynamical properties that then emerged

85

out of the regional oceanographic context and out of the local-scale modifications of the regional
ocean features as they approached the coast. In doing so, the aim was to provide some insights into
possible mechanisms that determine the nature and origin of MHWs (MCSs) within regionally distinct
ocean/coastal sections. We hypothesised that i) local coastal MHW events are coupled with offshore
broad-scale thermal patterns; ii) MCSs originate at the local scale in the coastal in situ dataset as

90

isolated incidents decoupled from broader-scale patterns; iii) different coastal sections, each variously
influenced by interactions between local- and broad-scale processes, display different dynamics (timing,
count, duration and intensity) of MHWs (MCSs); and iv) the count of warm (cold) events increases
(decreases) with time under a regime of climate change. The effect of atmospheric forcing on coastal
events was considered but not assessed within the scope of this study.

2. Methods
2.1. Study region
The variety of oceanographic features around the ca. 2,700 km long South African coast provides a
natural testing bed for the potential effects of different ocean forcing mechanisms on the occurrence
of MHWs and MCSs. Annual mean (± standard deviation; SD) coastal seawater temperatures range

100

from 12.3±1.2°C at the western limit near the Namibian border (Site 1) to 24.4±2.0°C in the east near
the Mozambican border (Site 21). Our study sites covered this full range (Figure 1). We classified the
coast into three regions based on their major oceanographic features, their temperature characteristics,
and aspects of the underlying continental shelf. The west coast region is dominated by the Benguela
Current, which forms an Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (EBUS) (Hutchings et al., 2009). Seasonal

105

upwelling is maintained by prevailing south-easterly trade winds and low temperatures are especially
noticeable at upwelling cells over a relatively narrow continental shelf in the region from the Cape
Peninsula to Cape Columbine. The west coast represents a cool temperate regime, with the range
of monthly mean temperatures at most sections intermediate between cold temperate and warm
temperate (Lüning et al., 1990). The warm temperate east coast region is strongly influenced by the

110

warm south-westerly flowing Agulhas Current, which hugs tightly along the narrow continental shelf
(except for the Natal Bight) (Lüning et al., 1990). This stretch of coast is spatially homogeneous with
respect to temperature and characterised by a moderate amount of seasonal variation. Although the
Agulhas Current retroflects back into the southern Indian Ocean (Hutchings et al., 2009) just south of
the much wider and cooler Agulhas Bank (Roberts, 2005), its influence regularly extends as far west

115

as False Bay (Sites 5–21; Figure 1). Lying between the west and east coasts, the south coast region is
that overlying the Agulhas Bank. Although also warm temperate, it experiences a much larger range

south-westerly direction, and hugging the continental shelf. The blueish patches north of the Cape Peninsula
represent upwelled water. Some upwelled water may also be present around Sites 14 (Tsitsikamma) and 15–16

in annual temperature and variability compared to the west and east coast regions, which is in part
influenced by the retention and cooling of Agulhas Current water on the bank, the presence of some
current-driven upwelling cells along this coastal section (Sites 15–17) (Roberts, 2005), and from the
120

effects of capes and embayments throughout the region. A more detailed description of these three
coastal regions may be found in Smit et al. (2013).
2.2. Temperature data
The in situ seawater temperature dataset used in this study was comprised of 127 records of daily
measurements of up to 40 years with a mean duration of ca. 19 years. These in situ time series are

125

generally shorter than the recommended 30 year minimum for the characterisation of MHWs (Hobday
et al., 2016) and have occasional gaps of missing data. However, there is a clear benefit of using
in situ data over satellite data as they provide a more accurate representation of the the thermal
characteristics near the coast that affect coastal ecosystems. This is because satellite SST measurements
5

at the coast have been shown to perform poorly for capturing maximum and minimum temperatures
130

(e.g. Smale and Wernberg, 2009; Castillo and Lima, 2010). In a South African context, Smit et al.
(2013) have shown that satellite SST data display a warm bias as large as 6°C over in situ temperatures
in the nearshore environment. We found 10 years to be the minimum duration required to generate
an acceptable estimate of the climatology required for the identification of MHWs (MCSs) therefore,
all time series under 10 years in duration were excluded. Time series missing more than 10% of their

135

daily temperature measurements were also excluded, leaving a total of 21 time series. These were then
classified into the three coastal regions detailed above. Metadata for the selected time series, including
location, duration, and the coastal regions they were aggregated into can be found in Table S1. The
site localities are displayed spatially in Figure 1.
The remotely sensed temperature dataset used in this study were the daily 1⁄4° NOAA optimally

140

interpolated SST (OISST; Reynolds et al., 2007) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR). To compare the offshore mesoscale (OISST dataset) extreme events against
those along the coast (in situ dataset), shore-normal transects were drawn from each of the 21 sites
extending to the 200m isobath. Temperature values from the OISST data were then extracted at each
of the roughly 25 × 25 km pixels along these transects, shown as black boxes in Figure 1. Where

145

the shelf was less than 25 km wide (Sites 17–21) the nearest ‘ocean pixel’ to the in situ time series
coordinate was used. We decided to use mean temperatures along these shore-normal transects as they
better represent the mesoscale temperatures we were interested in comparing against the coastal events,
rather than simply using the nearest OISST pixel, as this would only draw a comparison between the
two different data types at the coast, and not the mesoscale activity in the ocean. The individual time

150

series within each pixel of each transects were then averaged to create 21 time series to match against
the 21 in situ sites. These 21 OISST time series could then be analysed for MHWs (MCSs) in the
same way as the in situ data (see below). Note that the OISST time series had valid data covering
1982–2015 which did not match exactly with the individual in situ sites.
2.3. Defining and calculating MHWs and MCSs

155

MHWs are defined here following Hobday et al. (2016) as “discrete prolonged anomalously warm
water events in a particular location.” MCS are defined in the same manner as MHWs with the
exception of being “anomalously cold water events”.
To detect anamolous events, a climatological mean and 90th and 10th percentiles were first calculated
for each day of the year within each time series by pooling all data within an 11-day window across

160

all years. An 11 day window was chosen to ensure a robust estimate of the climatological mean as
well as the 90th and 10th percentile thresholds. MHWs (MCSs) were detected as periods of time when
temperatures exceeded (fell below) the 90th (10th) percentile for at least five days. The 90th (10th)
percentile was used rather than the 95th (5th) or 99th (1st) so as to allow for the detection of a greater
number of anamolous events. This is an important consideration as it is not only the very largest

165

events that may pose a threat to local ecosystems. Starting from the 3 day minimum duration set for
atmospheric heatwaves in Perkins and Alexander (2013), different minimum lengths for the definition

Table 1: Metrics of MHWs and their descriptions as proposed by Hobday et al. (2016). In the case of MCSs,

of marine events were tested for by Hobday et al. (2016). They found that a minimum length of 5
days allowed for more uniform global results in event detection; therefore, we have used this 5 day
minumum length in our study, too. Since our in situ time series were of differing durations, with many
170

under the proscribed 30 years, we calculated the climatology over all available years; in the case of the
OISST data, climatologies were calculated over a fixed 33-year base period (1982–2015). Furthermore,
discrete events with well-defined start and end dates but with ‘breaks’ between events lasting ≤2 days
followed by subsequent ≥5 day events were considered as continuous events (Hobday et al., 2016).
After the events were defined, a set of metrics (Table 1) were calculated including maximum and mean

175

intensity (measured as anomalies relative to the climatological mean, in °C), duration (time from start
to end dates, in days), and cumulative intensity (the integrated intensity over the duration of the
event, analogous to degree-heating-days; °C·days). MCS intensities are calculated as negative values
(i.e. anomalies) and are reported in the text as such. When comparing MHW and MCS intensities the
absolute values of these metrics were used.

180

A Python script (https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves; see Hobday et al., 2016) was
used to calculate the individual MHWs (MCSs) for both the in situ and OISST time series. After the
individual events were recorded, mean annual values for the metrics seen in Table 1 were calculated for
each year of each times series. This provided two different sets of measurements for the extreme events
that will be referred to specifically throughout this paper. ‘Annual’ data refer to the annual means of

185

events for each year of each time series whereas ‘event’ data refer to the individually calculated events
within each time series.
Because MHWs (MCSs) were calculated relative to percentile exceedances, rather than absolute
definitions such as periods with temperatures above an arbitrary fixed temperature threshold, any
time of year could have experienced a MHW (MCS). This is an important and necessary consideration

190

to make as, for example, unusually warm waters that occur during the winter months of a year, the
time when many species need cold water for effective spawning/spore release, can have a negative
effect on the recruitment success of that population for the year (Wernberg et al., 2011).
2.4. Detecting co-occurrence of coastal and offshore events
In order to better understand the potential impact offshore mesoscale phenomena had on local

195

coastal events, the proportion of MHWs (MCSs) that co-occurred between the two datasets was
calculated for each matched time series. This was initially done by taking each event (warm and

7

cold) within an in situ time series and looking for an event in the matched OISST time series that
occurred within a certain period of time before the in situ date. These co-occurrence proportions
were used to describe how often the mesoscale oceanography off the coast may have led to extreme
200

events that occurred locally along the coast. All events that occurred outside of the dates shared
between the matched time series were removed from this calculation. The sum of OISST events found
to occur within the shared date window was then divided by the sum of events in the in situ time
series that occurred during that same period to produce a co-occurrence proportion. The proportions
of co-occurrence were then recalculated controlling for the size of the lag window used when comparing

205

the two different datasets for concurrent events, as well as the directionality used for this comparison.
In other words, a range of window sizes from 2–14 days were used for each site to see how far apart
events generally occurred and the lag period used was also applied after the in situ events, allowing us
to see how often coastal events led the offshore events.
In addition to controlling for the duration and direction of lag, the sizes of the individual events

210

were factored into the calculations of co-occurrence proportion. This was accomplished by ranking
the events within each time series in steps of 10th percentiles by cummulative intensity. Comparisons
were then made between matched sites with smaller events progressively removed until only the largest
events were being compared. This allowed us to isolate the proportion of co-occurrence found within
each site that was caused by smaller events that occurred at similar times as large events, which

215

were more likely to have co-occurred randomly, and not an indication of a teleconnection between the
datasets.
The top three MHWs (MCSs) for each in situ and OISST time series as defined by cumulative
intensity were also noted in order to visually compare the co-occurrence of events in detail, both within
and between the different datasets.

220

2.5. Decadal trends in MHWs and MCSs
Given that the anthropogenic forcing of climate change has intensified over the past few decades
(Stocker et al., 2013), it stands to reason that, as a function of the 90th and 10th percentiles, the larger
MHWs would be near the end of the time series and the larger MCSs near the beginning. This can be
tracked visually by looking at the top three warm and cold events for each time series. Given that the

225

OISST time series are greater than 30 years in duration it is possible to discern the long term trends
within the data apart from the noise of any inter-decadal patterns (Schlegel and Smit, in press). Using
generalised linear models (Poisson with log-link), the decadal trend in the annual count of MHWs
(MCSs) were calculated for all OISST time series as well as the in situ time series over 30 years in
duration. The 17 in situ time series under 30 years were cut in half and the sum of the annual count of

230

both warm and cold events for each half was calculated. Using a series of general linear hypotheses
(Hothorn et al., 2008) we tested the significant differences between the count data in the first and
second halves of the time series for the overall count of MHWs (MCSs) as well as each coastal region.
The sum of MHWs (MCSs) in the second half of each time series was divided by the sum of those in

8

the first to produce proportional values of event occurrence that could be used to compare the different
235

coastal sections.

3. Results
3.1. Event metrics
Using series of general linear hypotheses (Hothorn et al., 2008) to look for differences in the
metrics of MHWs (MCSs) between datasets and between coastal regions (Table 2) revealed significant
240

differences in the count of MHWs (MCSs) between the in situ and OISST datasets, with the OISST
dataset displaying more events of both kinds (MHWs: t=-5.37, p<0.01; MCSs: t=-5.28, p<0.01). There
were no differences in the number of warm or cool events within either of the datasets, nor in the
number of MHWs (MCSs) between coasts.
MHWs (MCSs) in the OISST dataset were of greater duration than in the in situ dataset (MHWs:

245

t=-2.34, p<0.05; MCSs: t=-3.31, p<0.01). Comparing events between coasts within the in situ dataset,
MCSs along the east coast were shorter than along the south (t=5.41, p<0.01) or west coasts (t=2.06,
p<0.05); MHWs showed the same response, with the duration along the east coast less than along
the south (t=3.79, p<0.01) or west coasts (t=2.67, p<0.01). In the OISST dataset, MCSs along the
east coast were only significantly shorter than those on south coast (t=2.83, p<0.01); MHWs on the

250

east coast were shorter than those on the south (t=6.01, p<0.01) and west coasts (t=3.79, p<0.01). A
comparison of the duration of MHWs against MCSs within coast and dataset showed that the durations
of the two event types were identical. The one exception being along the east coast within the OISST
dataset where MCSs were longer than MHWs (t=-2.70, p<0.01).
The in situ dataset yielded more intense MHWs (t=19.80, p<0.01) and MCSs (t=14.19, p<0.01)

255

than the OISST dataset. Looking at the difference in intensity of events within the dataset, MCSs
were more intense than MHWs in the OISST dataset (t=-4.10, p<0.01). There were also differences in
the intensity of MHWs and MCSs between coasts within a dataset. Within the in situ dataset, the
intensity of event types was greater along the south coast for both MHWs (south vs. east: t=-2.58,
p<0.01; south vs. west: t=3.28, p<0.01) and MCSs (south vs. east: t=5.48, p<0.01; south vs. west:

260

t=-6.66, p<0.01). More intense MCSs were present in the OISST dataset on the south coast compared
to the east (t=-2.15, p<0.05), whereas MHWs were less intense along the east compared to the south
(t=3.01, p<0.01) or west coasts (t=2.18, p<0.05). Focussing on differences between coasts and within
datasets, MHWs in the in situ dataset were more intense than MCSs along the west (t=4.48, p<0.01)
and east coasts (t=3.06, p<0.01), whereas MCS were more intense than MHWs along the south coast

265

(t=-5.66, p<0.01). A coastal difference in intensity of MHWs and MCSs in the OISST dataset was
only seen along the east coast (t=-4.36, p<0.01), with MCSs being greater.
The mean annual statistics shown in Table 2 give a broad overview of the events that occurred
along the coasts; however, an examination of the largest MHWs and MCSs provided a clearer picture as
to which coastal sections showed the most intense events. The ranking of these events was based on the

270

cumulative intensity metric as explained in Table 1. To calculate the mean cumulative intensity of all

Table 2: The mean (±SD) values for event count, duration and mean intensity from the annual data for
MHWs and MCSs for each coastal section as calculated from the in situ (A) and OISST (B) time series. The
aforementioned annual data were averaged across all years for all time series within each respective coast to
produce the mean values shown. Lower case letters indicate if any of the coastal sections differ within the
same dataset and event type, with metrics sharing the same letter being statistically indistinguishable from
one-another. For example, the duration of MHWs on the east coast in the in situ data were significantly less
than MHWs on the west and south coasts, which were not significantly different. The upper case letters indicate
if the coastal sections differ between the datasets, but within coast and event type. For example, the count of
MCSs on the west and east coasts were not significantly different whereas the count of MCSs on the south
coast in the OISST dataset was significantly greater than in the in situ dataset.

events it was necessary to use the individual event data, and not the annual mean data used for Table 2.
Doing so for MHWs from both datasets showed a significant difference (t=7.68, p<0.01) in the mean
(±SD) cumulative intensities with the in situ dataset (26.11±24.37°C·days) having greater cumulative
intensities than in the OISST dataset (18.65±15.10°C·days). The mean (±SD) cumulative intensities
275

for MCSs between the two datasets were also significantly different (t=2.99, p<0.01) with the in situ
events (26.45±24.25°C·days) being greater than the the OISST events (23.17±23.49°C·days).
3.2. Patterns in mean cumulative intensity
The three largest (greatest cumulative intensity) MHWs within the in situ dataset were all recorded
along the south coast (Table 3). The cumulative intensity of the three largest events along the west

280

coast were less than the greatest three south coast events, but greater than the largest three MHWs
from the east coast. This is due in part to the events on the south coast having had greater durations
than the other two coastal sections, which influenced the cumulative intensity metric. As with the
MHWs, the largest three MCSs from the in situ data were also on the south coast (Table 3). The west
coast had the next largest three events and the east coast the smallest. The south coast MCSs had

285

greater durations than the MCSs from the other coastal sections, but were less pronounced than the
MHWs.
The pattern seen in the in situ dataset of the largest MHWs and MCSs having occurred on the
south, west and east coasts respectively was not repeated with the OISST dataset. Whereas the single
largest MHW occured on the south coast in the OISST data, the three largest MHWs from the west

290

coast were larger than the second and third largest events from the south coast (Table 3). The three

largest MHWs from the east coast were again smaller than those from the other coasts. Assigning the
largest MCSs from the OISST dataset to either the south or west coasts was not possible due to an
inconsistent pattern here. The east coast MCSs from the OISST dataset were however consistently the
smallest three events. All of the coastal sections in the OISST dataset had at least two of their largest
295

MCSs occurring at similar times at different sites. This is a level of co-occurrence that the in situ data
did not show.
A three-way ANOVA on the individual event data for both the in situ and OISST data combined
(i.e. as with the annual data) with three factors (coast, event type, dataset) showed significant marginal
effects and interactions between all factors (p≤0.03).

300

As well as having had significantly different cumulative intensities, Figure 2 shows that the three
largest events within each time series in the OISST dataset often occurred at different times from those
seen in the in situ dataset. In addition, the OISST events showed a greater amount of co-occurrence
with events detected at neighboring coastal stations than the corresponding in situ time series did.
The daily temperatures on the dates of the largest MHW (MCS) from the west and south coasts in

305

the in situ dataset are shown concurrently with the daily temperatures from the OISST time series
on matching dates in Figure 3. When these largest events were occuring in the in situ data, the
temperatures in the OISST data did not show similarly intense events.
3.3. Co-occurrence proportions
The proportion of co-occurrence found for MHWs (MCSs) between the datasets for each site can

310

be seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively. When using the lag windows both before and after the
occurrence of an in situ event to compare the in situ and OISST events, increasing the width of the
lag window from 2 to 14 days caused the mean proportion of co-occurrence for all sites to increase
linearly for MHWs (0.09 to 0.38) and MCSs (0.10 to 0.30). Using these same constraints, the south
coast sites had the largest mean increase in co-occurrence for MHWs (0.10 to 0.45) and MCSs (0.11 to

315

0.34), whereas the west coast sites showed the smallest increase for MHWs (0.07 to 0.28) and MCSs
(0.08 to 0.19). With all variables controlled for in the same manner, the co-occurrence proportions
between the different coastal sections were not significantly different for MHWs or MCSs at 2 day nor
14 day lags (p≥0.12).
The directionality of the lag window affected the proportion of co-occurring events. Comparing all

320

events within a 14 day lag window before the in situ event gave higher mean (±SD) proportions of
co-occurrence for MHWs (0.22±0.13) than for the same lag window after the in situ event (0.18±0.10).
This same comparison for MCSs showed that the lag window before the in situ event (0.16±0.09) had
a slightly lower proportion of co-occurrence than the lag window after the in situ event (0.17±0.08).
When the smaller events were screened from comparison and only the largest half of the events used

325

(50th percentile), the difference in mean (±SD) co-occurrence proportions for MHWs lessened to
0.16±0.11 before the in situ event and 0.15±0.12 after. The mean (±SD) co-occurrence proportion of
MCSs at this level was less when using a lag window before the in situ event at 0.05±0.08 than for a
lag window after at 0.08±0.08.

There was no co-occurrence in the paired time series for the largest MCSs, whereas four of the 21
330

paired time series showed co-occurrence for their largest MHWs (Figure 4). Interestingly, these four
paired time series were on the south coast and three of the four showed co-occurrence for their largest
MHW when the in situ event preceded the OISST event.
3.4. Decadal trends in MHWs and MCSs
The decadal trends in MHWs (MCSs) calculated for each OISST time series are given in Table 4.

335

The mean (±SD) decadal trend for MHW occurrence in the OISST dataset is 0.2±0.1 dec−1 across all
sites and -0.3±0.3 dec−1 for MCSs. The decadal trends in MHW occurrence were less in the colder
Benguela-fed west coast than the warmer Agulhas-driven east coast with the mean (±SD) decadal
MHW trend on the west coast being 0.1±0.1 dec−1 , the south coast being 0.2±0.2 dec−1 and the east
coast being 0.3±0.1 dec−1 . Just as MHWs occured more frequently per decade on the east coast than

340

the west, the count of MCSs decreased more on the east coast than the west. The decadal trend of
MCSs on the west coast is 0.0±0.2 dec−1 , -0.4±0.2 dec−1 on the south coast and -0.5±0.2 dec−1 on
the east coast.

Of the four in situ time series that reached the 30 year minimum length, the mean (±SD) decadal
trend for MHWs is 0.2±0.4 dec−1 and -0.1±0.3 dec−1 for MCSs. There were two sites from the west
345

coast and two from the south, excluding the east coast from a possible calculation of decadal change
for in situ MHWs (MCSs). The mean (±SD) decadal trend for MHWs (MCSs) on the west coast is
0.0±0.3 dec−1 (-0.2±0.5 dec−1 ) and 0.4±0.4 dec−1 (0.0±0.3 dec−1 ) on the south. Note that none of
the decadal trends for MCSs from the >30 year in situ time series from the west coast were significant.
The mean (±SD) proportion of MHWs that occurred during the second half of the shorter time

350

series was 1.7±1.3 (p=0.37) and that of MCSs was 0.8±0.6(p=0.39), neither being significantly different.
The counts for both MHWs and MCSs between the first and second halves of the time series for the
west and south coasts were significantly different. Showing agreement with the longer time series, the
short west coast time series had significantly more MHWs in their second half at 1.5±0.6 (p=0.03), but
differed from the longer time series by having more MCSs in the second half at 1.8±0.6 (p<0.01). The

355

short south coast time series showed agreement with the longer time series in that the proportion of
MHWs in the second half of time series was greater at 2.1±1.4 (p<0.01) and the proportion of MCSs
in the second half was lesser at 0.5±0.3 (p<0.01). The short east coast time series however, showed no
agreement with their longer counterparts. The proportion of MHWs in the second half of these short
time series was 0.7±0.4 (p=0.10) and the proportion of MCSs was 1.0±0.8 (p=0.57).

3.5. Offshore MHWs and MCSs
Figure 6 shows the mean count, duration and intensity of each pixel from the OISST dataset as
derived from the annual data for the region of ocean surrounding southern Africa. The pixels with the
highest annual counts of MHWs occurred well south of the tip of the continent whereas some of the
most frequent MCS activity was found directly against the west coast and some small regions of the

365

south coast. As for the duration of events, it is clear from Figure 6 that the MHWs (MCSs) detected
in the Agulhas current are relatively short-lived compared to those in the open ocean with almost
all pixels that showed events in the upper range of duration detected well away from the coast. The
offshore events along the west and south coasts have centers of intensity very near the shore whereas
the east coast generally does not. The most intense events detected in the OISST data are found along

370

or south of the south coast.
Whereas the mean count, duration and intensity of MHWs and MCSs offshore are telling, the
picture is not complete without also considering the trend in these metrics, too. Figure 7 shows that the
count, duration and intensity of MHWs increased almost exclusively throughout the studied regions of
the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. The count of MCSs decreased most rapidly along the coast of southern

375

Africa with a couple of notable exceptions near Port Elizabeth and north of the Cape Peninsula where
the count of MCSs increased very near to the coast. The duration of MCSs is seen to have generally
increased further offshore with most of the nearshore region having changed little or decreased. The
intensity of MCSs either changed little near the coast or increased dramatically, as seen in the dark
blue spot north of the Cape Peninsula in the “MCS Intensity (mean) Trend” panel in Figure 7.

4. Discussion
Our results clearly show that MHWs (MCSs) detected in two different ocean temperature datasets
displayed markedly different counts, durations, intensities and timing in their occurrence. These
differences appear to be related to the nature and variability of physical oceanographic processes at
broad- and local-scales, and the coupling of the processes across these scales. These finding illustrate

385

how a study of the properties of anomalous events can provide novel insights into drivers of the thermal
regime along coastlines, and can be used to arrive at some mechanistic insights into the nature and
origin of MHWs (MCSs).
4.1. Relation between local- and broad-scale MHWs and MCSs
The difference between the in situ and OISST datasets was striking. We anticipated a large degree

390

of coupling between the anomalously warm events manifesting in datasets that encapsulate local- and
broad-scale patterns, as represented by the in situ and OISST datasets, respectively. We found instead
that the broad-scale dataset yielded heatwaves that were more frequent and longer in duration, but
less intense than their local-scale counterparts. Cold-spells, for which we expected a greater deal of
decoupling between local- and broad-scale manifestations, showed more evidence of such than MHWs.

395

MCSs were more frequently seen and lasted longer in the OISST data; however, the mean intensity of
MCSs at the broad-scale was less than at the coast. The significantly larger intensities of both MHWs
and MCSs from the in situ data may be an artefact of the inability of remotely sensed data to record
the maximum and minimum temperatures that in situ instruments are capable of detecting (Smale
and Wernberg, 2009).

400

Of the metrics presented in this paper, cumulative intensity is perhaps the most important
ecologically. As a product of the intensity and duration of an event, cumulative intensity may be used
as an index to measure the threat of extreme events to coastal ecosystems, as is done with coral reefs
(e.g. Selig et al., 2010). Research conducted on the damaging effects of extreme events (e.g. Wernberg
et al., 2013) record the cumulative temperature above the seasonal average experienced by the coastal

405

ecosystem in question. As the body of research on extreme events increases, we think that these
cumulative intensity values may be used to establish a global index of the thresholds for different
ecosystems at which ecological perturbations, impairment or destruction has occurred. Combined
with near real time monitoring, this metric may then be used to improve the decision making process
on how when and how best to respond to unusually warm or cold bodies of water. Furthermore, we

410

found in this study that the cumulative intensity of events at the coast were not only greater than the
corresponding OISST events, but that the upper range was much greater.
We found that the majority of the events in the paired time series between the two datasets were
unrelated and that some other influence(s) could have had a more pronounced effect on the temperatures
experienced at the coast than mesoscale forcing of ocean temperatures from offshore. This conclusion

415

is important in light of the very strong mismatch in temperatures recorded by thermal loggers installed
in situ at the coast (i.e. local-scale) compared to measurements of the ocean’s temperature from space
21

(i.e. broad-scale) (Smit et al., 2013). Smit et al. (2013) showed biases of up to +6 °C between the
same local-scale dataset used here and AVHRR and MODIS Terra SST, with a strong spatial pattern.
The insight emerging from the present study is that there are not only spatial influences affecting the
420

mismatch between local- and broad-scale thermal patterns, but that there is a temporal component to
these biases too. In other words, it is not possible to apply a constant and simple bias adjustment to
the in situ and SST time series used by Smit et al. (2013). Such a deterioration of the offshore thermal
signal in coastal waters is known to occur due to the local modifications of nearshore circulation
patterns by headlands, embayments, influences of the bathymetry and other such perturbations that

425

introduce eddies and fronts and a shoaling of the thermocline (Okubo, 1973; Pingree and Maddock,
1979; Wolanski and Hamner, 1988; Black et al., 1990; Grundlingh and Largier, 1991; Graham and
Largier, 1997). These processes are not yet fully understood, and what understanding we do have
of physical oceanographic process remains weighted toward the mesoscale, as was noted by Graham
and Largier (1997) in their study on upwelling shadows, another process responsible for the local

430

modification of a phenomenon that is generally studied at the broad-scale. These local-scale deviations
are know to affect coastal ecological processes, such as the transport, dispersal and settlement of larvae
(Pineda, 1994; McCulloch and Shanks, 2003; Narváez et al., 2004) and the dynamics of phytoplankton
and nutrient delivery (Graham and Largier, 1997; Pineda, 1994), and it is likely that thermal patterns
over similar scales will also have local significance for the biology of the nearshore region.

435

4.2. MHWs and MCSs in different coastal sections
There was no difference in the annual count of events between coasts within each dataset (Table 1),
but differences did emerged in a comparison of the duration and intensity metrics. The east coast
differed from the other two coastal sections in that MHWs and MCSs at both the local- and broad-scale
were of shortest duration there; however, comparing the event duration between events, we see that in

440

this region the cold spells lasted longer than heatwaves. Furthermore, the east coast also displayed
the least intense MHWs but most intense MCSs of any coastal region along offshore portions of
South Africa’s coastline. This stretch of coastline is heavily influenced by the warm Agulhas Current,
separated from the coast only by a very narrow and steep continental shelf, which abruptly expands
into the >200km wide Agulhas Bank south of Port Alfred (Figure 1). This narrow continental slope

445

margin allows upwelling on the shoreward side of the Agulhas Current to occur along the entire length
of the east coast, independent of local atmospheric conditions (Lutjeharms et al., 2000). It is therefore
possible that this constant forcing of the Agulhas Current on the east coast would cause the events
arising there to dissipate more quickly and return to a ‘normal,’ less variable state. This seems to be a
plausible explanation for why the largest events, both hot and cold, recorded on the east coast are

450

so much smaller than those along the other two coastal sections. We suggest that the hydrodynamic
properties of the Agulhas Current have prevented any prolonged temperature events from persisting.
Contrary to this conclusion it is the clear from the literature that some of the largest documented
heatwaves have been caused by anomalously high heat content of ocean currents, such as the Leeuwin
Current in the case of the Western Australia MHW (Feng et al., 2013; Pearce and Feng, 2013; Wernberg
22

455

et al., 2013). Conversely, large MHWs such as that documented in the north west Atlantic Ocean in
2012 have been shown to be coupled strongly with atmospheric phenomena (Mills et al., 2012; Chen
et al., 2014, 2015). Therefore, while no MHWs or MCSs with cumulative intensities rivalling those of
the largest events seen on the other two coasts have yet occurred on the east coast, the potential exists
for some further-afield phenomenon to cause such an event there.

460

The south coast is fundamentally different from the other coastal sections in that it is dominated
not by one strong current, such as the Agulhas or Benguela Currents, but rather consists of a broad
continental shelf on which the interplay of these two currents form a ‘mixing-pot’ between two oceans,
as well as hosting an attendant array of complex coastal processes that modify the already thermally
variable waters overlying the Agulhas Bank (Lutjeharms et al., 2003; Roberts, 2005; Hutchings et al.,

465

2009). Consequently this section of coastline has one of the most variable thermal regimes along the
entire South African coastline. Some of the in situ time series here are recorded in relatively shallow
embayments, allowing for atmospheric heating to have a marked effect there — as is indeed seen in
the cumulative intensities for MHWs in False Bay — and further offshore sheer-edge forcing creates
eddies resulting from the departure of the Agulhas Current from the Agulhas Bank that may then be

470

projected across the shelf (Lutjeharms et al., 2003). Such high temperature events last longer, and
even if their mean intensities are lower, this contributes towards their high cumulative intensities.
The significantly more intense MCSs on the south coast are attributed to the much greater mean
intensity of events around Tsitsikamma (Sites 12–14). Without these three sites the MCSs on the south
coast are not significantly greater than those along the other two coastal sections. (Roberts, 2005)

475

hypothesised that a wind forced upwelling cell occurs near Tsitsikamma and the mean intensity of the
events recorded here seems to support this.
The west coast does not show exceptional patterns in MHW and MCS metrics. At first glance, we
were surprised to find that the mean intensity of west coast (EBUS) coastal MCSs is lower than those
on the south coast. Upwelling systems are defined by periodic occurrences of cold water of deep origin

480

near the coast (Lutjeharms et al., 2000; Hutchings et al., 2009) and it seems intuitive to associate
these with the cold-spells. But cold upwelled water defines the climatology for the region, and for a
cold-spell to manifest in an upwelling region the temperature of that water would have to be colder
than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year climatological baseline period and would have to last for
five or more days. Accordingly, upwelling events that occur within a seasonally predictable cycle are

485

not extreme in nature, and are therefore not flagged as MCSs. An upwelling event would need to be
particularly cold or a-seasonal in its occurrence to be recorded as a MCS. This is certainly possible;
however, the very nature of the required a-seasonality of MCSs obfuscates which phenomena may
potentially be driving the extreme cold temperatures. This consideration casts doubt on our thoughts
to use MCSs as a means to detect the intensification of upwelling, which is a plausible prediction in

490

an age when Earth’s climate gradually warms (García-Reyes et al., 2015). Results show that offshore
MCS are, on average, lasting significantly longer, occurring significantly more often and the largest
events are more intense. As upwelling is known to occur along the coast here (Hutchings et al., 2009),

23

that the offshore MCSs occur more often and last longer is strong evidence that the MCS algorithm is
not a good proxy for upwelling detection and that the coastal cold events detected here are likely due
495

to other factors. Upwelling events should have notable properties, such as rate of onset and duration of
peak intensity, which set them apart from other events that may cause colder water to occur at the
surface. Further work on the definition of the characteristics of upwelling events could be coupled with
the MCS algorithm for accurate use in upwelling detection in temperature time series.
4.3. Patterns in mean cumulative intensity

500

The pattern of mean cumulative intensity within the local-scale data was very clear in that warm
and cold events on the south coast were much more extreme than those along the west and east coasts.
The OISST data were less conclusive on whether the south or west coast experienced the most extreme
events, but it is apparent from all of the analyses from both datasets that the east coast experienced
very few extreme MHWs or MCSs. These findings suggest that the east coast is the most thermally

505

stable of the three coastal sections, and that MHWs or MCSs with mean cumulative intensities that
could potentially damage ecosystems are least prone to develop there. It is the south coast region,
however, where coastal ecosystems are most at risk due to excessively warm events.
Within the south coast (Sites 5–17), the sites within False Bay (Sites 5–7) have greater cumulative
intensities for MHWs and MCSs than the sites over the Agulhas Bank (Sites 8–17). Whereas the

510

Agulhas Bank experiences more thermal variation than the other two coastal sections, False Bay,
which is ~50 km across, is situated within the transition zone between the Benguela and Agulhas
Currents (Smit et al., 2013) and contains the most variable time series in the entire in situ dataset.
Lower resolution satellite temperature products, such as Pathfinder version 5.0, have been shown to
inadequately resolve the SST within the relatively small body of water that is False Bay (Dufois and

515

Rouault, 2012). Embayments such as this often display thermal ranges (both temporally and spatially)
large enough to effect species ranges (Ling et al., 2009) and are of great ecological (Klumb et al.,
2003) and economic importance (Lugendo et al., 2005). We think that such regions are also more
prone to MHWs (and perhaps MCSs) due to an even stronger decoupling from broad-scale thermal
patterns and drivers: indeed, two of the three largest MHWs and MCSs detected in the local-scale

520

dataset were recorded within False Bay, whereas only one large MHW and no MCSs were detected
there within the OISST dataset. This illustrates the problem of using satellite temperature data for
coastal ecological applications, and emphasizes the need for more comprehensive coverage of coastal
ecosystems in long-term in situ seawater temperature monitoring programmes.
Although we are are generally sceptical of use of most gridded SST products for coastal applications,

525

there are exceptions to this general ‘rule’ in situations where a good deal of local knowledge of regional
oceanographic patterns and processes is available. The aforementioned wind forced coastal upwelling
cell near Tsitsikamma (Sites 12–14) argued by Roberts (2005) being one example. That these three
sites show greater cumulative intensities for MCSs than all but one time series from the OISST dataset
may support the hypothesis for the existence of such a coastal upwelling cell. It is important to stress

530

here, however, that the usefulness of the SST product does not reside in its use in isolation, but that
24

our findings based on this product are compared and contrasted with findings derived from an analysis
of the local-scale set of data. We also need to be aware that, as mentioned earlier, the current MCS
algorithm should not be taken as showing upwelling events per se with any fidelity. Greater insight is
necessary before hypotheses about upwelling can be investigated in this manner. This would be an
535

intriguing use of the MCS algorithm if it can be used to validate one of multiple competing hypotheses
that as of yet may not have been able to be tested in any other way. This would however require
additional data such as changes in salinity and/or nutrients, vertical velocity or wind speeds.
4.4. Co-occurrence proportions
When OISST events that preceded in situ events within specific lag window were compared, the

540

proportions of co-occurrence for MCSs were much lower than for MHWs (Figure 4 and Figure 5). This
shows that if these events are indeed related, more MHWs are being caused by mesoscale activity
than MCSs, as was expected. This finding is supported further by comparing the proportions of
co-occurrence for MCSs lagged before and after in situ events. More MCS from the OISST data are
shown to occur after in situ events for all coastal sections. This may suggest some local heat loss

545

process, perhaps related to atmospheric cold events, cooling the waters near the coast, which then
gradually with time spread to waters further offshore. Such localised coastal phenomena have been
implicated for several of the cold spells which have caused mass mortalities of some marine species
(e.g. Gunter, 1941; Firth et al., 2011). The co-occurrence proportions of MHWs before and after the in
situ events are similar, implying that MHWs may propagate onshore from offshore mesoscale activity

550

and that MHWs originating near the coast and seeping offshore to affect the thermal regime appear
there to be equally possible.
We also infer from the proportions of co-occurrence of time series on the south coast, which are
generally much higher than at the other two coasts, that events are caused by the much higher level
of influence from mesoscale phenomena occurring over the Agulhas Bank. We also see that there is

555

a higher proportion of co-occurrence for the larger MHWs and MCSs on the south coast when a lag
window after the in situ event is applied. This supports the argument that events originating in the
nearshore are then propagating out onto the Agulhas Bank and affecting the oceanography there more
often than mesoscale events originating on the Agulhas Bank are affecting the nearshore environment.
The overall low rate of co-occurrence for all three coastal sections reinforces the argument that it is not

560

the mesoscale phenomena of the open ocean abutting the southern African landmass that are driving
events in the nearshore.
The very low proportion of co-occurrence between the datasets, and the decline in the proportion
as the smaller events are screened out is strong evidence against the hypothesis that mesoscale activity,
both warm and cold, is causing nearshore thermal events. The small increases in co-occurrence for

565

some sites as only larger events were compared does imply that there is some relationship between the
inshore and offshore at some localities, but that some other variable (e.g. atmospheric forcing) may be
having a greater effect on inshore events.

25

Another important consideration is the co-occurrence of the events with the highest mean cumulative
intensity within and between datasets. None of the dates for the top three MHWs or MCSs for any of
570

the coastal sections from the in situ dataset are the same (Table 3). They are all individually different
events occurring at different times. The OISST dataset tells an entirely different story in that all
but one of the coastal sections, for both MHWs and MCSs, have at least two of the three top events
occurring at the same time. This means that the largest events detected in the OISST dataset occur
over a broad area at the same time, whereas the in situ events are isolated temporally and spatially.

575

This further reinforces our conclusion that the events detected by the different datasets are often
intrinsically different from one another.
A final consideration to address for the apparent lack of relation between these datasets is that the
OISST temperatures are remotely sensed representations of the surface and though they are converted
from a “skin” temperature (roughly a micron deep) to a “bulk” temperature (roughly half a metre

580

deep) (Reynolds et al., 2007), 7 of the 21 time series from the in situ dataset were recorded deeper
than this with 2 of them recorded deeper than 10 metres. However, these deeper in situ data are still
comparable to the "bulk" upper mixed layer the OISST data are calibrated to measure as there is
little vertical layering within the nearshore environment. Furthermore, the OISST temperatures are
averaged across the width of the continental shelf at each site, and not simply to the nearest available

585

pixel, largely addressing any inconsistencies in temperature caused by mismatches in depth as the
mixed layer of the mesoscale temperature patterns of the open ocean should be comparable in depth
to the nearshore water column. It is then worth noting that water temperatures being measured in
the in situ dataset represent the area where the coastal biota are living, and is better able to reflect
what temperature patterns/ exposure the coastal flora and fauna experience. Therefore two datasets

590

are necessary: one for the coast; one for the ocean. The aim is not to compare the accuracy of the
two datasets to detect the same events, rather this study aims to show that fundamentally different
outcomes exist, and that in order to show the vulnerability of coastal biota to climate change, an
appropriate dataset must be used.
4.5. Climate change

595

As MHWs and MCSs are temperature related phenomena we would be remiss not to discuss the
relevance of our findings in relation to climate change. Although all but four of the in situ time series
used in this investigation are too short to draw adequate conclusions on the decadal trends seen in
MHWs and MCSs, the OISST data are not. As hypothesised, these data show positive decadal trends
for MHWs and negative trends for MCSs. This means that over the past 33 years of satellite observation

600

along our shore-normal transects, MHWs have been increasing every decade for each coastal section
while MCSs have been decreasing. Whereas the literature surrounding the potential increase (decrease)
of MHWs (MCSs) in the ocean is still in its infancy, atmospheric scientists have been investigating
the shift in extreme events for over a decade. Both historic and modelled research shows that climate
change is leading to an increase of extreme hot events in the atmosphere (Easterling et al., 2000;

26

605

Perkins and Alexander, 2013), and decreasing extreme cold events (Meehl, 2004). It is not surprising
to find the same pattern in the ocean.
When one looks more broadly at the ocean around southern Africa this pattern generally holds up.
We see in Figure 7 that the count, duration and intensity of MHWs have almost exclusively increased
throughout the studied regions of the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The count of MCS has decreased

610

most rapidly along the coast of southern Africa with a couple of notable exceptions near Port Elizabeth
and north of the Cape Peninsula where the count of MCSs is increasing very near to the coast. The
duration of MCSs is seen to generally increase further offshore with most of the nearshore changing
little or decreasing. The intensity of MCSs is either changing little near the coast or is increasing
dramatically, as seen in the dark blue patch north of the Cape Peninsula in the “MCS Intensity

615

(mean) Trend” panel in Figure 7. This means that a consistent >30 year trend in extreme cold events,
more so than anywhere else in this region of the ocean, has been acting on the coastal waters here.
Investigations into the impact this may have had on these ecosystems may produce interesting findings
in regards to the effect of climate change on ecosystems.
Though less conclusive than the trends calculated from the longer time series, similar patterns were

620

found in the shorter in situ time series as well. As the algorithm used to calculate these events is based
on percentiles, it stands to reason that as the mean temperature of South Africa’s coastal waters has
been increasing by 0.1°C per decade on average since the early 1970s (Schlegel and Smit, in press),
there will be an increase in MHWs and a decrease in MCSs. The gradual mean increase in temperature
will cause the algorithm used here to be biased in its detection of MHWs as time progresses simply

625

because temperatures are generally warmer in the later half of the time series therefore, the chances of
the algorithm detecting a MHW increases because the base temperature from which the MHW will be
fluctuating from will be greater than the beginning of the time series. Ultimately, for the species and
ecosystems experiencing this increase in duress, the semantic argument of the viability of percentiles
provides little solace.

630

Although Hobday et al. (2016) provide caveats regarding using event metrics across datasets, we
nevertheless feel that it would be informative to bring the heatwave metrics measured along the South
African south coast into context by comparing them with MHWs from regions (see Hobday et al.,
2016). We see that at our coastal locations, Muizenberg and Mossel Bay, heatwaves have on average
cumulative intensities ranging from 156.4 to 310.30 °C·days, mean intensities from 1.77 to 4.47 °C

635

and lasting from 35 to 98 days. The two longest individual MHW events experienced by the Western
Australian reef system (Feng et al., 2013) had a cumulative intensity of 237 °C·days, a mean intensity
of 2.5 °C and a duration of 95 days in 1999; and a cumulative intensity of 276 °C·days, a mean intensity
of 2.51 and a duration of 110 days (and ongoing at the time of their analysis) in 2014. The 2012
MHW of the north west Atlantic (Mills et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014) had a cumulative intensity of

640

145 °C·days and mean intensity of 4.00 °C over 56 days, while the subsequent 2012/2013 heatwave
went to 443 °C·days and a mean intensity of 2.59 °C and lasted for 187 days. Both of these MHWs
were reported to have had major ecological consequences (Feng et al., 2013; Mills et al., 2012; Chen

27

et al., 2014), but no investigations have yet been done to see if similar negative effects have taken
place at the sites where we have recorded intense heatwaves locally. Probably none have occurred as
645

evidence for such do not exist amongst the fisheries survey data collected annually, but a more detailed
investigation is warranted to see if some of the ecological changes known for the south coast region
(Bolton et al., 2012) can be linked to such events. Nevertheless, considering that the south coast is a
‘hot-spot’ for heatwaves, the fact that these events are increasing in count and knowledge that events
already experienced in the region are already on par with the intensity and duration of similar events

650

known to have had ecological effects elsewhere in the world, it is a matter of time before South Africa
experiences a similar marine environmental ‘natural’ disaster.

5. Conclusion
Given that the MHW algorithm is based on the percentiles found within each time series and
not on arbitrarily decided minimum or maximum thresholds, one will always find a certain number
655

of MHWs and MCSs in any time series. It is our experience with these data that every time series
used from both datasets experiences, on average, at least one MHW and MCS per year. Within each
dataset, but not between, the count of events is similar for each coastal section, regardless of the
local oceanographic and geographic properties. Instead, it is the duration, mean intensity and also
the derived cumulative intensity of the events occurring on the different coastal sections that most

660

clearly define spatial differences — so much so, that this will almost certainly translate to different
rates of vulnerabilities of coastal sections, both the ecosystems and the humans that derive benefit
from them, to the ravages of climate change. As the proportion of co-occurrence of events between
the local- and broad-scale dataset are generally low, and the magnitude of events within the different
datasets differ significantly from one another, we infer that some other force outside of mesoscale

665

temperature phenomena is contributing to inshore events. We think that direct atmospheric forcing of
coastal thermal heating is one such driver that needs immediate research attention in order to better
understand what is driving the occurrence and intensity of these events.
We have provided a cursory look at an oceanographic basis for explaining these differences, but we
think that there is an urgent need to consider more carefully the complex local-scale modifications of

670

broader-scale patterns seen further afield in order to fully appreciate the drivers of coastal thermal
variability in space and time. That such studies are still lacking in an age when the pulse of the
global ocean is measured with exquisite precision is a reflection on the oceanographic community’s
ongoing preoccupation with mainly broad-scale patterns and processes. Globally comprehensive ocean
temperatures are made available almost in real time, but to the best of our knowledge the top coastal

675

temperature databases are all comprised of records retrieved from delayed-mode instruments. In the
latter case, near-real-time warnings of the onset and intensity of MHWs (or MCSs) are not yet feasible,
whereas it is already possible to develop and implement such warning systems using currently-available
gridded satellite SST products. Researchers in the tropics, on coral reefs specifically, are already doing
just this as they implement (near) real-time satellite data for the monitoring of coral bleaching (e.g.

http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/index.php). Other coastal communities should learn from the
work of tropical communities in implementing monitoring systems for extreme temperatures, which is
now becoming relevant as climate change is threatening previously (relatively) stable ecosystems, such
as temperate kelp forests (Wernberg et al., 2013). We have shown that there is an urgent need for such
warning systems to be implemented, and feel that the need is greatest for coastal ecosystems as it is

here where the MHWs and MCSs are most intense.
