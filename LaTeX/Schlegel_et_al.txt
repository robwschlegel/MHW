    As climates change it is necessary that we understand the new challenges
    this may create. The shallow water ecosystems found along the coastlines
    of the world are particularly at risk as their temperatures may change
    more rapidly and dramatical than waters in the open ocean. To this end
    it is necessary that we identify the occurrence of extreme events,
    referred to here as Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) and Marine Cold-Spells
    (MCSs), in the nearshore environment as both strong warm and cold events
    may be damaging to local flora and fauna. We have taken a recently
    developed algorithm that defines these extreme events in a novel way and
    applied it to the *in situ* time series available for the coast of South
    Africa that are longer than 10 years and with at least 90% complete
    daily records. We found that MHWs and MCSs occur along the entirety of
    the coast of South Africa and with some temporal and spatial agreement
    between the largest events detected. MHWs occur more often, last longer
    and have greater cumulative intensities than MCSs. The cumulative
    intensity \[C\] for most MHWs and MCSs were comparable however, several
    were much larger and there tended to be specific areas that displayed
    more extreme events than the coastal average. The coast was further
    divided into three sections (west, south, and east) to investigate the
    effect of geography and differing oceanographic conditions on MHWs and
    MCSs and it was found that the south coast experiences longer, more
    intense and a greater count of MHWs and MCSs than the other two coastal
    sections. The south coast is a region of mixing between two major
    currents, the Benguela and Agulhas, though the exact mechanism driving
    the higher intensity of events their requires further study. The largest
    three MHWs in each of the time series along the coast of South Africa
    have generally occurred in the second half of the time series whereas
    the largest three MCSs have generally occurred in the first half. Thus
    implying that MHWs are on the rise while MCSs are declining. These same
    calculations were conducted for offshore temperatures from NOAA
    Optimally Interpolated sea surface temperature (OISST) data along
    shore-normal transects for each *in situ* station and for the oceans
    around southern Africa. It was found that a similar pattern of
    increasing MHWs and decreasing MCSs existed. An additional finding was
    that the proportion of co-occurrence between *in situ* and OISST data
    for each coastal section ranged from 0.20–0.50 with co-occurrence rates
    for both MHWs and MCSs being the largest on the south coast. Most
    individual time series showed co-occurrence rates between 0.25–0.50 for
    both MHWs and MCSs with co-occurrence rates generally higher for MHWs.

Introduction
============

Over the past three decades, anthropogenically mediated warming has
negatively affected marine and terrestrial realms with far reaching
consequences for humanity and natural ecological functioning. Although
climate change is generally understood as a gradual long-term rise in
global mean surface temperature [@IPCC2014], which will continue for
decades or centuries, it is generally the associated increase in the
count and severity of extreme events that affects humans and ecosystems
in the short-term [@Easterling2000]. Impacts of extreme events such as
floods, wind storms, tropical cyclones, heatwaves and cold-spells are
often sudden with catastrophic consequences. ‘Pulse’ events exceeding
certain thresholds of count, intensity, duration, timing and rate of
onset can drive punctuated perturbations to species distributions, which
eventually modify the structure and function of ecosystems
[@Wernberg2013; @Rehage2016], and the recognition to focus more on the
extremes and less on the background mean state has emerged as a recent
direction of climate change research [@Jentsch2007].

‘Heatwaves’ usually refer to atmospheric phenomena where vague
definitions such as “a period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot
weather” are invoked [@Glickman2000], but there are also precise
definitions based on statistical properties and other metrics of the
temperature record that are relative to location and time of year [e.g.
@Meehl2004; @Alexander2006; @Fischer2010; @Fischer2011; @Perkins2013].
Recent years have seen investigations of heatwaves in the ocean due to
them becoming more frequent [e.g.
@Mackenzie2007; @Selig2010; @Sura2011; @Lima2012; @DeCastro2014].
Well-known marine heat waves (MHW) have occurred in the Mediterranean in
2003 [@Black2004; @Olita2007; @Garrabou2009], off the coast of Western
Australia in 2011 [@Feng2013; @Pearce2013; @Wernberg2013], in the north
west Atlantic Ocean in 2012 [@Mills2012; @Chen2014; @Chen2015] and now
the “Blob” from 2014 to 2016 in the north east Pacific Ocean
[@Bond2015]. The extreme temperatures from these events may have
negative impacts upon the local ecology for the regions in which they
occur. For example, the 2003 Mediterranean heatwave may have affected up
to 80% of the gorgonian fan colonies in certain areas of this sea
[@Garrabou2009], whereas the 2011 event off the west coast of Australia
has been recognized as being a driving factor in the regime shift there
from temperate kelp forests to the beginnings of a coral reef system
[@Wernberg2013]. The extensive bleaching of corals in Australia in early
2016 has also been attributed to masses of anomalously warm waters
(refs.).

Although the consequences of these anomalously warm events are widely
publicised, the events themselves have until recently not been
objectively characterised. Consequently, @Hobday2016 have defined MHWs
as “a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be
described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial
extent”, and in doing so have derived statistical metrics that
characterise these properties. For example, the count of MHWs within a
time series and their maximum and cumulative intensity are quantifiable
parameters that can be calculated in a consistent manner irrespective of
geographical location. Practically, we are now able to determine
thresholds of certain metrics, which when exceeded, can be linked to
impairments and alterations of ecological systems. The focus of this
paper is on marine thermal events that are extreme with respect to the
seasonal climatology as per the @Hobday2016 definition. They may be
anomalously warm events, or anomalously cold (marine cold-spells, MCSs;
introduced here). While MHWs are becoming reasonably well known by
virtue of their increasing frequency and intensity, MCSs have received
less recognition. Whereas extreme hot events may be demonstrably
damaging to organisms and ecosystems, extreme cold events also have the
potential to negatively impact organisms and ecosystems. In both cases
their drivers and dynamics, particularly in the coastal zone, remain
poorly understood.

MCSs are projected to become less frequent under future climatic
scenarios, but there are also examples of them becoming more frequent in
some localities [e.g. @Gershunov2008; @Matthes2015]. They are frequently
lethal [@Woodward1987] and are known to have caused mass fish
[@Gunter1941; @Gunter1951; @Holt1983] and invertebrate
[@Gunter1951; @Crisp1964] kills, the death of juvenile and sub-adult
manatees [@OShea1985; @Marsh1986] as well as affecting organismal
physiological tolerances, life history strategies, and habitat
requirements [@Ellis2015]. Cold temperatures are very important in
setting species population distribution limits, particularly limiting
their range north- or southwards towards high latitudes [@Firth2011],
and the timing of the onset of the growing season [@Jentsch2007]. It is
easy to postulate how population-level consequences might aggregate to
drive whole ecosystem responses [e.g. @Kreyling2008; @Rehage2016].
Indeed, the range contractions of ecosystem engineer species such as
mussels have been shown to relate to MCSs [@Firth2011; @Firth2015].

Some of the MCSs known to have impacted populations were caused by
cold-spells affecting the intertidal and coastal biota locally
[@Gunter1941; @Firth2011]. We hypothesise that these localised events
are manifestations of extreme atmospheric warm or cold weather phenomena
situated over the coast. On the other hand, we think that broader-scale
drivers may also affect the thermal properties and dynamics of coastal
systems. There is by no means a good understanding of the relative
contributions of local- *vs.* broad-scale drivers of coastal MHWs and
MCSs, as such studies have not yet been undertaken to the best of our
knowledge. The origin of MHWs at any scale seems conceptually straight
forward: it seems likely that they result directly from atmosphere-ocean
heat transfer. In a world that is warming, their intensity and frequency
will increase over time when their magnitude is computed relative to a
long-term climatology. But what about MCSs — in a warming world, why
would their intensity/frequency increase? The answer to this question
probably lies with physical ocean processes that influence the
redistribution of heat. For example, large-scale
atmospheric-oceanographic coupling is being affected by global warming,
which is projected to cause the intensification of upwelling favourable
winds and consequently the intensification and increasing count of
upwelling events [see @Garcia-Reyes2015 for a review of this and
alternative hypotheses]. We therefore propose that the development of
coastal MCSs can be attributed to an intensification of upwelling. Since
MHWs and MCSs are both able to affect ecosystem change, a mechanistic
understanding of their drivers will be invaluable. To this end our study
serves as a constructive first step to understand the prevalence of
anomalous thermal events with respect to forcing mechanisms at different
scales.

@Hobday2016 applied their MHW framework to  NOAA optimally interpolated
sea surface temperature data [hereafter referred to as OISST;
@Reynolds2007], but warned users to be cognisant that different data
sets would provide different kinds of information pertaining to
heatwaves. Our study applies the MHW (MCS) definition to datasets of
coastal *in situ* (local-scale) and offshore gridded SST (broad-scale)
temperature time series collected at different locations along
coastlines influenced by contrasting ocean currents — the Benguela
Current, an eastern boundary upwelling system, and the Agulhas Current,
warm temperate — and locally modified by regional aspects of the coastal
bathymetry and geomorphology and other smaller scale coastal features.
These systems, assessed within a framework that couple local- and
broad-scale features, permit us to assess how MHWs (MCSs) develop in
coastal regions. Specifically, we aim to assess the significance of MHWs
(MCSs) within the context of i) the data sets’ inherent differences, ii)
the various dynamical properties that then emerge out of the regional
oceanographic context, and iii) out of the local-scale modifications of
the regional ocean features as they approach the coast. In doing so, we
wish to provide a mechanistic understanding of the nature and origin of
MHWs (MCSs) within oceanographically distinct ocean/coastal regions. The
working hypothesis is that MHWs and MCSs manifesting offshore and
onshore are decoupled (no difference in timing, duration, frequency and
intensity). We predict that coastal MHW events are coupled with synoptic
scale ocean thermal patterns visible across the offshore region at
scales of 100s of kilometres, and that MCSs originate at a local scale
as isolated incidents. The possibility of atmospheric forcing on coastal
events is considered a very likely possibility but it was not assessed
within the scope of this study.

Methods
=======

Study region
------------

The variety of oceanographic features around the *ca*. 2,700 km long
South African coast provides a natural testing bed for the potential
effects of different ocean forcing mechanisms on the occurrence of MHWs
and MCSs. Annual mean (standard deviation; hereafter referred to as
“sd)” coastal seawater temperatures range from 12.3 (1.2)C at the
western limit near the Namibian border (Site 1) to 24.4 (2.0)C in the
east near the Mozambican border (Site 21), and our study sites were
selected to cover this full range (). We classify the coast into three
regions based on their major oceanographic features, their temperature
characteristics, and aspects of the underlying continental shelf. The
first is the west coast region dominated by the Benguela Current, which
forms an Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (EBUS) [@Hutchings2009].
Seasonal upwelling is maintained by prevailing south-easterly trade
winds. Evenly low temperatures are especially noticeable at upwelling
cells over a relatively narrow continental shelf in the region
northwards of the Cape Peninsula to Cape Columbine. The west coast
defines a cool temperate regime, with the range of monthly mean
temperatures at most sections intermediate between cold temperate and
warm temperate [@Luning1990]. The second region is the warm temperate
[@Luning1990] east coast where the influence of the south-westerly
flowing warm Agulhas Current flowing tightly along the narrow
continental shelf (except for the Natal Bight) is strongly felt. This
stretch of coast is spatially homogeneous with respect to temperature
and characterised by a moderate amount of seasonal variation. Although
the Agulhas Current retroflects back into the southern Indian Ocean
[@Hutchings2009] just south of the much wider and cooler Agulhas Bank
[@Roberts2005], its influence regularly extends as far west as False Bay
(Sites 5–21; ). The third coastal region is that overlying the Agulhas
Bank. Although also warm temperate, it experiences a much larger range
in annual temperature and variability compared to the west and east
coast regions, which is in part influenced by the retention and cooling
of Agulhas Current water on the bank, the presence of some
current-driven upwelling cells along this coastal section (Sites 15–17)
[@Roberts2005], and because of the effects of embayments and capes
throughout the region.

Temperature data
----------------

We use two sources of seawater temperature data. The first dataset is
comprised of 127 records of *in situ* temperature records of daily
measurements for up to 40 years in duration with a mean duration of
*ca*. 19 years. Whereas these *in situ* time series are generally
shorter than the recommended 30 year minimum [@Hobday2016] and have some
small amounts of missing data, it is our opinion that the benefit of
using *in situ* data over satellite data is that they give a better
representation of the temperatures felt by coastal ecosystems as well as
the thermal characteristics near the coast, a region where satellite SST
measurements have been shown to perform poorly [e.g.
@Smale2009; @Castillo2010]. In a South African context, @Smit2013 have
shown that satellite SST data display a warm bias as large as 6C over
*in situ* temperatures in the nearshore environment. In an attempt to
compromise between the proscribed requirements in @Hobday2016 of a 30
year minimum and making use of this valuable dataset, all time series
under 10 years in duration were eliminated. We found 10 years to be the
minimum duration required in order to generate a robust estimate of the
climatology required for the identification of MHWs and MCSs. Next, the
remaining time series were further screened and those missing more than
10% of their daily values were removed, leaving a total of 21 time
series. Care was taken to select continuous series with as few as
possible consecutive missing values, since having regions in the data
with more than two consecutive missing data points interferes with the
identification of the anomalous events (see below). These stations were
classified into three coastal sections defined by properties of their
oceanography and biogeography @Smit2013. Details on the selected time
series, including location, duration, and the coastal sections they were
aggregated into may be found in and the site localities are displayed
spatially in .

The second set of temperature data used in this study are the daily
 NOAA optimally interpolated sea surface temperature [OISST;
@Reynolds2007] derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR). To compare the offshore meso-scale (OISST dataset) extreme
events against those along the coast (*in situ* dataset), shore-normal
transects were drawn from each of the 21 sites extending to the 200m
isobath. Temperature values from the OISST data were then extracted at
each of the roughly 25  25 km pixels along these transects, shown as
black boxes in , starting 25 km from the shore. Where the shelf was less
than 25 km wide (Sites 17–21) the nearest ‘ocean pixel’ to the *in situ*
time series coordinate was used. It was decided to use mean temperatures
along these shore-normal transects as they better represent the
meso-scale temperatures we were interested in comparing against the
coastal events, rather than simply using the nearest OISST pixel, as
this would only draw a comparison between the two different data types
at the coast, and not the meso-scale activity in the ocean over the
continental shelf. The individual time series within each pixel of each
transects were then averaged to create 21 time series to match against
those calculated for the *in situ* sites. These 21 OISST time series
could then be analysed for MHWs (MCSs) in the same way as the *in situ*
data (see below). Each individual pixel from the OISST dataset for the
oceans around southern Africa was also analysed for MHWs and MCSs. This
allowed for a broad overview of the occurrence of extreme events on the
mesoscale. Note that the OISST time series had valid data covering
1982–2015 which did not match exactly the coverage by individual *in
situ* sites.

Defining and calculating MHWs and MCSs
--------------------------------------

MHWs are defined here following @Hobday2016 as “discrete prolonged
anomalously warm water events in a particular location.” MCS are defined
in the same manner as MHWs with the exception of being “anomalously cold
water events”.

First, a climatological mean and 90th and 10th percentiles were
calculated for each day of the year by pooling all data within an 11-day
window across all years. MHWs (MCSs) were detected as periods of time
when temperatures exceeded the 90th (10th) percentile for at least five
days. The implication was therefore that MHWs (MCSs) could develop
outside of the warm (cold) season (i.e. winter (summer) months). Since
our *in situ* time series were of differing durations we calculated the
climatology over all available years; in the case of the OISST data,
climatologies were calculated over a fixed 33-year base period
(1982–2015). Furthermore, discrete events with well-defined start and
end dates but with ‘breaks’ between events lasting $\leq$2 days followed
by subsequent $\geq$5 day events were considered as continuous events.
After the events were defined, a set of metrics () were calculated
including maximum and mean intensity (measured as anomalies relative to
the climatological mean, in C), duration (length from start to end
dates, in days), and cumulative intensity (the integrated intensity over
the duration of the event analogous to degree-heating-days, in C).
Although MCS intensities are calculated as negative values (i.e.
anomalies) they are reported here as absolute values.

  Name \[unit\]                   Definition

  the case of MCSs, values are calculated with respect to the 10th
  percentile and absolute intensity values are reported.<span
  data-label="table1"></span>

A Python script [https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves; see
@Hobday2016] was used to calculate the individual MHWs for both the *in
situ* and OISST time series. The script was modified to permit the
calculation of MCSs. After the individual events were recorded, mean
annual values for the metrics seen in were created for each year of each
times series. This provided two different sets of measurements for the
extreme events that will be referred to specifically throughout this
paper. ‘Annual’ data refers to the annual means of events for each year
of each time series whereas ‘event’ data refer to the individually
calculated events that have not been aggregated into annual means.

Because MHWs (MCSs) are calculated by percentiles, rather than absolute
definitions such as periods with temperatures above an arbitrary fixed
temperature threshold, any time of year could be shown to be
experiencing a MHW (MCS). This is an important consideration as
unusually warm waters occurring during the winter months of a year, the
time when many species need cold water for effective spawning/spore
release, can have a negative effect on the recruitment success of that
population for the year [@Wernberg2011].

Detecting co-occurrence of coastal and offshore events
------------------------------------------------------

In order to better understand the potential impact mesoscale phenomena
have on coastal events, the proportion of co-occurrence between the MHWs
(MCSs) found within each time series between the two datasets was
calculated. This was initially done by taking each event (warm and cold)
within an *in situ* time series and looking for an event occurring
within the OISST time series at the same site within a certain period of
time before the *in situ* date. These co-occurrence proportions were
used to describe how often the mesoscale oceanography off the coast
preceeded the extreme events occurring along the coast. Only events
occurring on dates within those of each time series were used for this
calculation. The sum of events found to occur within the same time frame
was then divided by the total number of *in situ* events that occurred
during the time period shared with the OISST data (which varies from
station to station) to produce a co-occurrence proportion. The
proportions of co-occurrence were then recalculated controlling for the
size of the lag window used when comparing the two different datasets
for concurrent events, as well as the directionality used for this
comparison. In other words, a range of window sizes from 2-14 were used
for each site to see how far apart events generally occurred and the lag
period used was also applied after the *in situ* date. This allowed us
to see how often the *in situ* event preceeded the mesoscale event.

Besides controlling for the duration and direction of lag, the size of
the events themselves (ranked by cumulative intensity) was compared.
This was accomplished by controlling the pool of events with which to
compare the datasets per site in steps of 10th percentiles. This
progressively removed smaller events until only the larger events were
being compared. This allowed us to track the co-occurrence of only the
largest events, reducing the overall proportion of co-occurrence found
within each site as caused by the smaller events occurring at similar
times as large events.

The top three MHWs (MCSs) for each *in situ* and OISST time series as
defined by cumulative intensity were also noted in order to visually
compare the co-occurrence of events in detail, both within and between
the different datasets.

Given that the anthropogenic forcing of climate change is predicted to
increase the temperature of most of the ocean over time, it stands to
reason that, as a function of the 90th and 10th percentiles, one would
expect to see the larger MHWs near the end of the time series, and the
larger MCSs near the beginning. This can be tracked visually by looking
at the top three warm and cold events for each time series. Given that
the OISST time series are greater than 30 years in duration it is
possible to discern the long term trends within the data apart from the
noise of any inter-decadal patterns (Schlegel and Smit, in review).
Using a simple linear model, the decadal trend in the annual occurrence
of MHWs and MCSs was calculated for all of the OISST data as well as the
*in situ* time series that were over 30 years long. The shorter time
series simply had the proportion of MHWs or MCSs in the first half of
the time series compared against those in the second half to show if
there were more or fewer.

Results
=======

Events
------

Both annual datasets were combined so that a two-way ANOVA could be run
on them that considered the following factors when testing for signicant
differences: coast, event, data. Coast here refers to the three
different coastal sections, event refers to either MHWs or MCS and data
indicates whether the data are from the *in situ* or OISST datasets.
When searching through these combined annual datasets for differences in
the count of events it was found that there was a significant
differences between the two types of data (i.e. *in situ* vs. OISST
data) (*F*=50.27, df~1~=1, df~2~=2306, *p*&lt;0.01). There were also
significant differences between the coastal sections for the duration of
events (*F*=16.70, df~1~=2, df~2~=1612, *p*&lt;0.01) as well as the two
types of data (*F*=17.57, df~1~=1, df~2~=1612, *p*=0.39). The mean
intensity of events were significantly different between each coast
(*F*=36.51, df~1~=2, df~2~=1612, *p*&lt;0.01) and between MHWs and MCSs
(*F*=17563, df~1~=1, df~2~=1612, *p*&lt;0.01). There were also
significant interactions for mean intensity of the events between every
combination of all three factors. Therefore the mean intensity of both
MHWs and MCSs between the different coastal sections were significantly
different (*F*=3.292, df~1~=2, df~2~=1612, *p*=0.03), the mean intensity
of events from the different datasets between the different coastal
sections were significant (*F*=47.29, df~1~=2, df~2~=1612, *p*&lt;0.01),
as were the differences between MHWs and MCSs from the different types
of data (*F*=785.5, df~1~=1, df~2~=1612, *p*&lt;0.01) and ultimately
differences between MHWs and MCSs for the different coastal sections
from both datasets were significant, too (*F*=5.622, df~1~=1,
df~2~=1612, *p*&lt;0.01). Note that the degrees of freedom in the
results for the count of events differ from duration/mean intensity as
there were years within many time series in which there were no events.
These annual values were reported as 0 for the count results; however,
any years in which no events occurred had their resultant duration and
mean intensity values reported as NA.

  shown in this table. The lower case letters indicate if any of the

Top three events
----------------

The mean annual statistics shown in give a broad overview of the events
occurring along the coast; however, examining the largest MHWs and MCSs
better aids in our understanding of which coastal sections show the most
intense events. The ranking of these events are based on the cumulative
intensity metric as explained in . To calculate the mean cumulative
intensity of all events it was necessary to use the individual event
data, and not the annual mean data used for . Doing so for all of the
individual events from the *in situ* data we see that mean(sd)
cumulative intensity for MHWs along the coast is 26.11(24.37)C and
26.45(24.25)C for MCSs. The mean(sd) cumulative intensity over the
entire coast for the MHWs from the OISST dataset was lower at
18.65(15.10)C whereas the mean(sd) cumulative intensity of the MCSs from
the OISST data was much closer to the *in situ* value at 23.17(23.49)C.

The three largest MHWs that occurred within the *in situ* dataset were
all on the south coast (). The size of the south coast events are larger
than those along the west coast, with the largest three MHWs from the
east coast being the smallest. This is due in part to the events on the
south coast having a greater duration than the other two coastal
sections. As with the MHWs, the largest three MCSs from the *in situ*
data were also found on the south coast (). The west coast had the next
largest three events and the east coast the smallest. The south coast
MCSs had greater durations than the MCSs from the other coastal sections
but less pronounced than the MHWs.

The pattern seen in the *in situ* data of the largest MHWs and MCSs
having occurred on the south, west and east coasts respectively was not
repeated with the OISST dataset. Whereas the single largest MHW occurred
on the south coast in the OISST data, the three largest MHWs from the
west coast were larger than the second and third largest events from the
south coast (). The three largest MHWs from the east coast were again
smaller than those from the other coasts. The largest MCSs for the south
and west coasts from the OISST data were similarly shuffled with no one
coastal section having the three largest events. The east coast MCSs
were however consistent with other findings in that they were again the
smallest three events. All of the coastal sections in the OISST data
showed that at least two of their largest MCSs occurred at the same time
at different sites. This is a level of co-occurrence that the *in situ*
data did not show.

The individual event data for both the *in situ* and OISST data were
combined, as with the annual data, and a two-way ANOVA was run on both
datasets together using the factors: coast, event and data. The
differences between every factor and interactions between every factor
were found to be significant (p$\leq$0.03).

As well as having significantly different cumulative intensities, one
can see in that the three largest events occurring for each time series
within the OISST dataset are often different from the *in situ* dataset
and show a greater amount of co-occurrence for neighbouring coastal
stations than the corresponding *in situ* time series do.

The temperatures on the dates of the largest MHW and MCS for the west
and south coasts from the *in situ* data may be seen concurrently with
the temperatures from the matching OISST time series in . One may see
that when the largest events were occurring in the *in situ* data, the
temperature values in the OISST data did not show similarly intense
events.

Co-occurrence rates
-------------------

The proportion of co-occurrence found for MHWs and MCSs between the
datasets for each site may be seen in and respectively. When using the
lag windows before and after the *in situ* event and comparing all
events we see that as the width of the lag window increased from 2 to 14
days the mean proportion of co-occurrence for all sites increased
linearly for MHWs (0.09 to 0.38) and MCSs (0.10 to 0.30). Using these
same constraints we see that south coast sites had the largest mean
increase in co-occurrence for MHWs (0.10 to 0.45) and MCSs (0.11 to
0.34), whereas the west coast sites showed the smallest increase for
MHWs (0.07 to 0.28) and MCSs (0.08 to 0.19). With all variables
controlled for in the same manner, the co-occurrence rates between the
different coastal sections were not significantly different for MHWs or
MCSs at 2 day nor 14 day lags.

The directionality of the lag window also affected the co-occurrence of
events. Comparing all events within a 14 day lag window before the *in
situ* event gave higher mean(sd) rates of co-occurrence for MHWs
(0.22(0.13)) than for the same lag window after the *in situ* event for
MHWs (0.18(0.10)). This same comparison for MCSs showed that the lag
window before the *in situ* event (0.16(0.09)) had slightly lower rates
of co-occurrence than the lag window after the *in situ* event
(0.17(0.08)). When the smaller events were screened from comparison and
only the largest half of the events were used (50^th^ percentile), the
difference in mean(sd) co-occurrence proportions for MHWs event lessened
at 0.16(011) before the *in situ* event and 0.15(0.12) after. The
mean(sd) co-occurrence proportion of MCSs at this level was less when
using a lag window before the *in situ* event at 0.05(0.08) than for a
lag window after at 0.08(0.08).

There was no co-occurrence for the largest MCSs between the datasets,
whereas four of the paired time series showed co-occurrence for their
most extreme MHW (). Interestingly, all four time series were on the
south coast and three of the four showed co-occurrence for their largest
MHW when the *in situ* event preceded the OISST event.

Decadal trends in MHWs and MCSs
-------------------------------

In order to calculate the decadal trends in MHW and MCS count, linear
models were fitted to the annual count values for each 30+ year time
series. The slope of this line was then multiplied by ten to produce the
following decadal trend values and show whether over the last 30+ years
MHWs/MCSs have been increasing or decreasing. As the OISST data set is
over 30 years in duration, decadal values were calculated for each OISST
time series. It was found that the mean(sd) decadal trend for MHW
occurrence in the OISST dataset was 0.5(0.3) dec$^{-1}$ across all sites
and -0.7(0.6) dec$^{-1}$ for MCSs. The decadal trends in MHW occurrence
increase as one moves from the colder Benguela fed west coast to the
warmer Agulhas fuelled east coast with the mean(sd) decadal MHW trend on
the west coast being 0.3(0.3) dec$^{-1}$, the south coast being
0.5(0.3) dec$^{-1}$ and the east coast at 0.6(0.2) dec$^{-1}$. Just as
MHWs are occurring more frequently per decade on the east coast than the
west, MCSs are decreasing more frequently on the east coast than the
west. The decadal trend in MCSs on the west coast is
-0.1(0.6) dec$^{-1}$, -0.8(0.5) dec$^{-1}$ on the south coast and
-0.9(0.2) dec$^{-1}$ on the east coast.

Of the 21 *in situ* time series, only four of them reached the 30+ year
requirement. Of these four time series the mean(sd) decadal trend for
MHWs was found to be 0.3(0.5) dec$^{-1}$ and -0.1(0.5) dec$^{-1}$ for
MCSs. There were two sites from the west coast and two from the south,
excluding the east coast from a possible calculation of decadal change
for *in situ* MHWs and MCSs. The mean(sd) decadal trend for MHWs (MCSs)
on the west coast was 0.1(0.5) dec$^{-1}$ (-0.2(0.7) dec$^{-1}$) and
0.5(0.5) dec$^{-1}$ (0.1(0.4) dec$^{-1}$) on the south.

For the remaining 17 *in situ* time series we calculated the the sum of
the annual count of events in the first half of each time series
compared against the sum of the annual count of events in the second
half. This produced a proportion value that could be used as an
indicator as to how many more MHWs or MCSs were occurring in the second
half of the time series. The mean(sd) proportion of MHWs occurring in
the second half of the shorter time series was 1.7(1.3) whereas the
proportion of MCSs was 0.8(0.6), meaning that more of the MHWs are
occurring in the second half of time series than the first, and vice
versa for the MCSs. The shorter time series on the south coast showed
the pattern of having more MHWs in the second half of the time series at
2.1(1.4) and fewer MCSs in the second half at 0.5(0.3). The short west
coast time series had more MHWs in the second half at 1.5(0.6) as well
as more MCSs at 1.8(0.6). The east coast had fewer MHWs at 0.7(0.4) in
the second half of the shorter time series with the proportion of MCSs
in being roughly split between the first and second half of the time
series at 1.0(0.8).

The same algorithm used to detect MHWs and MCSs for the *in situ* and
coastal OISST data was then applied to every pixel in the OISST data to
detect MHWs and MCSs in the oceans around southern Africa. After the
individual events were detected, annual mean values were created so that
these results could be compared with the *in situ* results. shows the
mean count \[n\], duration \[days\], and intensity \[C\] of each pixel
from the OISST dataset as derived from the annual data. These data show
that the most MHWs occur south of the tip of the continent whereas some
of the pixels with the greatest count of MCSs may be found directly
against the west coast. As for the duration of events, it is clear from
that the MHWs and MCSs the satellite is detecting in the Agulhas current
are relatively short. Almost all of the pixels that show events in the
upper range of the durations detected occurred well away from the coast,
too. When calculating mean intensity for each individual pixel, the west
and south coasts show centres of intensity very near the shore whereas
the east coast generally does not. The most intense events detected in
the OISST data where found to occur along or below the south coast.

Using the individual events detected per pixel from the offshore OISST
data, decadal trends could be drawn using the same method detailed in
the previous section. One may see in that the count, duration and
intensity of MHWs have mostly been increasing throughout the studied
regions of the Indian and Atlantic oceans with only scattered pockets of
decrease. The count of MCS has been decreasing most rapidly along the
coast of southern Africa and over the Agulhas Bank with a couple of
notable exceptions near Port Elizabeth and north of the Cape Peninsula
() where the count of MCSs have been increasing very near to the coast.
The duration of MCSs is seen to generally increase further offshore with
most of the nearshore changing little or decreasing. THere is a strong
pocket of decreasing MCSs just off the coast from Port Elizabeth. The
intensity of MCSs is either changing little near the coast or is
increasing dramatically, as seen in the dark blue spot north of the Cape
Peninsula in the “MCS Intensity (mean) Trend” panel in . The intensity
of MCSs in the Atlantic is decreasing more rapidly and broadly than the
Indian ocean.

Discussion
==========

Events
------

It was surprising to find that the mean intensity of MCSs on the south
coast was significantly larger (*p*&lt;0.01) than MCSs found within the
EBUS on the west coast for the *in situ* data. From these results we may
now hypothesise that there is an as of yet unknown driver on the south
coast affecting the extreme cold events there that is not present on the
other two coastal sections.

The difference between the *in situ* and OISST datasets was striking.
Whereas the count of events for the west and east coast, as well as the
duration of events between all of the individual coastal sections
between the datasets were not significantly different, the count of
MHWs/MCSs on the south coast and the mean intensity values for each
coastal section were. The OISST data showed many weak events occurring
often whereas the *in situ* dataset showed fewer, significantly larger
events. This implies that a large number of the events occurring between
these two datasets are unrelated and that some other variable may be
having a more pronounced effect on coastal temperatures than the ocean
temperature. Before calculating the proportions of co-occurrence between
the datasets it was already clear from these results that the events
that occurred within the OISST data would differ from those of the *in
situ* data.

When considering all of the OISST events, and not only those found near
the coast, we see that the range of count, days and intensities are
similar to those found in the *in situ* data, but that these larger
events are generally occurring farther from the coast. This supports the
argument that the events detected along the coast by these two different
datasets were not the same, even when they were found to occur within
similar time frames.

Top three events
----------------

When considering the cumulative intensities of the individual events,
and not the annual mean values, we found the results to have more
significant differences. Given that the annual mean intensities for MCSs
were significantly larger in the *in situ* data, it was unexpected to
find that the largest three MCSs for each coast from the OISST data were
much larger than the *in situ* data. One would assume that as the *in
situ* data are measured at *ca*. 5m deep on average, which is below the
bulk surface layer (*ca*. 0.5m) that the OISST data measure
[@Reynolds2002], they would be predisposed to picking up cold upwelling
events and less exposed to thermal heating, which would appear as larger
MCSs and smaller MHWs compared to the OISST data.

This apparent discrepancy also places doubt on the use of MCSs as a
proxy for upwelling. If the *in situ* data had recorded longer and/or
more intense MCSs than seen in the OISST data it would have better
supported the argument that the MCS algorithm was detecting more extreme
cold events near the coast, where upwelling occurs
[@Lutjeharms2000; @Hutchings2009]. Instead the results show that the
cumulative intensity of MCSs on the south coast from the *in situ* data
alone are significantly larger than their OISST counterparts. We suggest
that using the MCS algorithm to detect upwelling be done with extreme
caution. The MCS algorithm detects cold events based on their intensity
outside of a locally produced climatology, and because most upwelling
occurs at seasonally predictable times, the cold events detected here
are likely due to other factors. Aside from this observation, upwelling
events should have notable properties, such as rate of onset and
duration of peak intensity, which set them apart from other events that
may cause colder water to occur at the surface. Further work on the
definition of the characteristics of upwelling events could be coupled
with the MCS algorithm for accurate use in upwelling detection in
temperature time series.

The disagreement between the *in situ* and OISST datasets continued into
the detection of the top three events for each coastal section. The
pattern of event sizes within the *in situ* data are very clear in that
events on the south coast are much more extreme than the west and east
coasts in that order. The OISST data are less conclusive on whether the
south or west coast experiences the most extreme events, but it is
apparent from all of the analyses from both datasets that the east coast
experiences very few extreme MHWs or MCSs. The duration of extreme
events off the east coast at the mesoscale level is also markedly
shorter than the other two coasts. This implies that meso-scale activity
may be having a greater driving force on the extreme events along the
east coast of southern Africa than the other two coasts.

The sites along the south coast could be further divided into those
within False Bay (Sites 5–7) and those on the Agulhas Bank (Sites 8–17).
False Bay, which is \~50 km across, is situated within the transition
zone between the Benguela and Agulhas Currents [@Smit2013]. Many
satellite temperatures products therefore inadequately resolve the SST
within this body of water (cite.). This is problematic as it is
important to precisely monitor the large ranges in temperature this area
experiences (cite.) as it is important both ecologically (cite.) and to
the many stakeholders that use this embayment. Two of the three largest
MHWs and MCSs from the *in situ* dataset were recorded within False Bay,
whereas only one large MHW and no MCSs were detected by the OISST
dataset. This illustrates the problem of using satellite temperature
data for coastal ecology.

The broad consistent patterns in MHW and MCS metrics detected throughout
the Indian and Atlantic oceans shows the usefulness of satellite SST
data to detect events near, but not adjacent to, the coast. For example,
@Roberts2005 argues for a wind forced coastal upwelling cell near
Tsitsikamma (Sites 12–14). That these three sites show greater
cumulative intensities for MCSs than all but one time series from the
OISST dataset may support the hypothesis of such a coastal upwelling
cell. Though as mentioned earlier, the current MCS algorithm should not
be taken as showing upwelling events with any fidelity. More research is
necessary if upwelling hypotheses like the aforementioned may be
investigated in this manner. This would be an intriguing use of the MCS
algorithm to validate multiple competing hypotheses that as of yet may
not have been able to be tested in any other way.

Another important consideration was the co-occurrence of the most
extreme events between and within time series. The fact that none of the
top three MHWs or MCSs for any of the coastal sections from the *in
situ* dataset occurred within a similar window shows that these events
all occurred independent of one another. Conversely, the OISST dataset
shows that all but one of the coastal sections for both MHWs and MCSs,
had at least two of the three top events occurring at the same time.
This means that the largest events detected in the OISST data were
occurring over a broad area at the same time whereas the *in situ*
events were isolated not only in time, but in the location in which they
were occurring. This further reinforces our conclusion that the events
detected by the different datasets are often intrinsically different
from one another.

Co-occurrence rates
-------------------

When looking at the lag window before the *in situ* events occurred, the
rates of co-occurrence for MCSs are much lower than for the MHWs. This
shows that if these events are indeed related, more MHWs are being
caused by meso-scale activity than MCSs, as was expected. This finding
is supported further by comparing the rates of co-occurrence for MCS
lagged before and after the *in situ* event occurred. More MCS from the
OISST data are shown to occur after the *in situ* events for all coastal
sections. The co-occurrence rates of MHWs before and after the *in situ*
events are similar.

One may also infer from the results that the proportions of
co-occurrence for time series on the south coast being much larger than
the other two coasts is caused by the much higher level of influence
from meso-scale phenomena occurring on the Agulhas Bank. We also see
that there is a higher proportion of co-occurrence for the larger MHWs
and MCSs on the south coast when a lag window after the *in situ* event
is used (). This supports the argument that events originating in the
nearshore are then propagating out onto the Agulhas Bank and affecting
the oceanography there more often than meso-scale events originating on
the Agulhas Bank are affecting the nearshore environment. Indeed, when
one looks at the mean intensity of events offshore from the south coast
it is plain to see that they are originating along the coast and
travelling south west with the Agulhas current. The region north of Cape
Point also shows areas of high intensity orignating at the coast and
radiating outward. This helps to explain why the south coast showed the
greatest proportion of co-occurrence for the three coastal sections,
with the west coast second.

The low proportion of co-occurrence between the datasets, and the
decline in the proportion as the smaller events are screened out is
strong evidence against the hypothesis that meso-scale activity, both
warm and cold, is causing nearshore extreme thermal events. The small
increases in co-occurrence for some sites as only larger events were
compared does imply that there is some relationship between the inshore
and offshore, but that some other variable (e.g. atmospheric forcing)
may be having a greater effect on inshore events.

Climate change
--------------

As MHWs and MCSs are temperature related phenomena we would be remiss
not to discuss the potential of our findings in relation to climate
change. The count of the MHWs and MCSs that occurred along the coast is
less telling in this regard than the trend in these events themselves.
Although all but 4 of the *in situ* time series used in this
investigation are too short to draw adequate conclusions on the decadal
trends seen in MHWs and MCSs, the OISST data are not. And as
hypothesised these data showed positive decadal trends for MHWs and
negative trends for MCSs. Meaning that over the past 33 years of
satellite observation along the shore-normal transects seen in , MHWs
have been increasing every decade for each coastal section while MCSs
have been decreasing. A synoptic view of the oceans around southern
Africa shows a similar pattern.

Other than the increasing (decreasing) MHWs (MCSs) over the Agulhas
bank, the lack of adherence to meso-scale and broad geographic features
in the oceans around southern Africa implies that some other variable is
affecting change in the extreme events in the ocean. Two minor, and one
major exception to this observation are the increases seen in the OISST
data for the count of MCS north of Cape Point and near Port Elizabeth,
both areas known for upwelling, as well as the major increase in mean
intensity of MCSs north of Cape Point. This means that a consistent 30+
year trend in extreme cold events, more so than anywhere else in the
oceans around Southern Africa, has been acting on the coastal waters
here. Investigations into the impact this may have had on the ecosystems
here may produce interesting findings in regards to the effect of
climate change on ecosystems.

Conclusion
==========

Given that the MHW algorithm is based on the percentiles found within
each time series and not on arbitrarily decided minimum or maximum
thresholds, one will always find a certain number of MHWs and MCSs in
any time series. This is evident in the results of our analysis in that
every time series used from both datasets experienced on average at
least one MHW and MCS per year. Within each dataset, but not between as
the *in situ* data for the south coast had significantly fewer MHWs/MCSs
than the OISST data, the count of events are similar for each coastal
section, regardless of the local oceanographic and geographic
properties. It is the cumulative intensity of the events occurring on
the different coastal sections that most clearly defines them. We
expected to see the most intense MCSs on the west coast as this is part
of an EBUS however, the south coast, a region dominated by the warmer
Agulhas Current, but with some influence from the colder Benguela, had
both the most intense and longest individual MHWs and MCSs in the *in
situ* data.

We have also shown that MCSs are not a good indicator for upwelling. As
upwelling tends to occur at seasonally predictable times, the MCS
algorithm may not consider these events as anomalous. Therefore the MCSs
measured here are indicators of non-seasonal or atypical forcing.

As the rates of co-occurrence between *in situ* and OISST data are
generally low, the mean intensity of *in situ* events for all coastal
sections are significantly larger and the largest events found within
the OISST data occur at similar times across broad coastal sections
whereas the *in situ* events do not, we conclude that some other force
outside of meso-scale phenomena is contributing to extreme inshore
events. This is likely due to atmospheric forcing and warrants further
research to better understand what is driving the occurrence and
intensity of these events.
