<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As climates change it is necessary
that we understand the new threats that this may create. The shallow
water ecosystems found along the coastlines of the world are
particularly at risk as their temperatures may change more rapidly
and dramatically than waters in the open ocean. To this end it is
necessary that we identify the occurrence of extreme ocean
temperature events, referred to here as Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) and
Marine Cold-Spells (MCSs), in the nearshore environment as both
strong warm and cold events may be damaging to local flora and fauna.
We have taken a recently developed algorithm that defines these
extreme events in a novel way and applied it to the in situ time
series available for the coast of South Africa that are longer than
10 years and with at least 90% complete daily records. We found that
MHWs and MCSs occur along the entirety of the coast of South Africa
and with some temporal and spatial agreement between the largest
events detected. MHWs occur more often and last longer than MCSs,
which have greater mean intensities. The cumulative intensity
(°C·days) for most MHWs and MCSs were comparable however, several
were much larger and there tended to be specific areas that displayed
more extreme events than the coastal average. The coast was further
divided into three sections (west, south, and east) to investigate
the effect of geography and differing oceanographic conditions on
MHWs and MCSs and it was found that the east coast experiences
shorter MHWs and MCSs than the other two coasts whereas the mean
intensity of MHWs was significantly smaller on the south coast while
the mean intensity of MCSs was significantly larger than the other
two coasts. These significant differences in mean intensities are
attributed to the effects of the interaction of the Agulhas and
Benguela currents. The largest three MHWs in each of the time series
along the coast of South Africa have generally occurred in the second
half of the time series whereas the largest three MCSs have generally
occurred in the first half. Thus implying that the occurrence of MHWs
is on the rise while for MCSs it is declining. These same
calculations were conducted for offshore temperatures from 1 ⁄ 4 °
NOAA Optimally Interpolated sea surface temperature (OISST) data at
the nearest locations to the in situ stations and it was found that a
similar pattern of increasing MHWs and decreasing MCSs existed. An
additional finding was that the proportion of co-occurrence between
in situ and OISST data for each coastal section ranged from 0.20–0.50
with co-occurrence rates for both MHWs and MCSs being the largest on
the south coast. Most individual time series showed co-occurrence
rates between 0.25–0.50 for both MHWs and MCSs with co-occurrence
rates generally higher for MHWs.</p>

<h1><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Over the past three decades,
anthropogenically mediated warming has negatively affected marine and
terrestrial realms with far reaching consequences for humanity and
natural ecological functioning. Although climate change is generally
understood as a gradual long-term rise in global mean surface
temperature [IPCC2014], which will continue for decades or centuries,
it is generally the associated increase in the count and severity of
extreme events that affects humans and ecosystems in the short-term
[Easterling2000]. Impacts of extreme events such as floods, wind
storms, tropical cyclones, heatwaves and cold-spells are often sudden
with catastrophic consequences. ‘Pulse’ events exceeding certain
thresholds of count, intensity, duration, timing and rate of onset
can drive punctuated perturbations to species distributions, which
eventually modify the structure and function of ecosystems
[Wernberg2013; Rehage2016], and the recognition to focus more on the
extremes and less on the background mean state has emerged as a
recent direction of climate change research [Jentsch2007].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">‘Heatwaves’ usually refer to
atmospheric phenomena where vague definitions such as “a period of
abnormally and uncomfortably hot... weather” are invoked
[Glickman2000], but there are also precise definitions based on
statistical properties and other metrics of the temperature record
that are relative to location and time of year [e.g. Meehl2004;
Alexander2006; Fischer2010; Fischer2011; Perkins2013]. Recent years
have seen investigations of heatwaves in the ocean due to them
becoming more frequent [e.g. Mackenzie2007; Selig2010; Sura2011;
Lima2012; DeCastro2014]. Well-known marine heat waves (MHWs) have
occurred in the Mediterranean in 2003 [Black2004; Olita2007;
Garrabou2009], off the coast of Western Australia in 2011 [Feng2013;
Pearce2013; Wernberg2013], in the north west Atlantic Ocean in 2012
[Mills2012; Chen2014; Chen2015] and now the “Blob” in the north
east Pacific Ocean [Bond2015]. The extreme temperatures from these
events may have negative impacts upon the local ecology for the
regions in which they occur. For example, the 2003 Mediterranean
heatwave may have affected up to 80% of the gorgonian fan colonies in
certain areas of this sea [Garrabou2009], whereas the 2011 event off
the west coast of Australia has been recognized as being a driving
factor in the regime shift there from temperate kelp forests to the
beginnings of a coral reef system [Wernberg2013]. The extensive
bleaching of corals on the great barrier reef in early 2016 may also
be due to increases in marine heatwaves that are preventing corals
from experiencing a necessary sub-lethal pre-bleaching warming period
[Ainsworth2016].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although the consequences of these
anomalously warm events are widely publicised, the events themselves
have until recently not been objectively characterised. In response
to this need, Hobday2016 developed a definition of a MHW as “a
prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described
by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent,”
and in doing so have derived statistical metrics that quantify these
properties. For example, the frequency of MHWs within a time series
and their maximum and cumulative intensity are quantifiable
parameters that can be calculated in a consistent manner irrespective
of geographical location. Practically, we are now able to determine
thresholds of certain metrics, which when exceeded, can be linked to
impairments and alterations of ecological systems. The focus of this
paper is on marine thermal events that are extreme with respect to
the seasonal climatology as per the Hobday2016 definition. They may
be anomalously warm events, or anomalously cold (marine cold-spells,
MCSs; introduced here). While MHWs are becoming reasonably well known
by virtue of their increasing frequency and intensity, MCSs have
received less recognition. Whereas extreme hot events may be
demonstrably damaging to organisms and ecosystems, extreme cold
events also have the potential to negatively impact organisms and
ecosystems. In both cases their drivers and dynamics, particularly in
the coastal zone, remain poorly understood.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">MCSs are projected to become less
frequent under future climatic scenarios, but there are also examples
of them becoming more frequent in some localities [e.g.
Gershunov2008; Matthes2015]. They are frequently lethal
[Woodward1987] and are known to have caused mass fish [Gunter1941;
Gunter1951; Holt1983] and invertebrate [Gunter1951; Crisp1964] kills,
the death of juvenile and sub-adult manatees [OShea1985; Marsh1986]
and even coral bleaching [Lirman2011]. Cold temperatures are very
important in setting species population distribution limits,
particularly limiting their range north- or southwards towards high
latitudes [Firth2011], and the timing of the onset of the growing
season [Jentsch2007]. It is easy to postulate how population-level
consequences might aggregate to drive whole ecosystem responses [e.g.
Kreyling2008; Rehage2016]. Indeed, the range contractions of
ecosystem engineer species such as mussels have been shown to relate
to MCSs [Firth2011; Firth2015].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although we understand that the SST
of the upper mixed layer is influenced by oceanic and atmospheric
processes [see Equation 1 of Deser2010], there is by no means a good
understanding of how these processes are modulated by local- <em>vs.</em>
broad-scale influences, thus resulting in coastal MHWs and MCSs. Such
studies have not yet been undertaken to the best of our knowledge.
Some of the MCSs known to have impacted populations were caused by
cold-spells affecting the intertidal and coastal biota locally
[Gunter1941; Firth2011]. We hypothesise that these localised events
are manifestations of extreme atmospheric cold weather phenomena
situated over the coast resulting in rapid heat loss from coastal
waters. On the other hand, we think that broader-scale
teleconnections may also affect the thermal properties and dynamics
of coastal systems. For example, large-scale
atmospheric-oceanographic coupling is being affected by global
warming, which is projected to cause the intensification of upwelling
favourable winds and consequently the intensification and increasing
frequency of upwelling events [see Garcia-Reyes2015 for a review of
this and alternative hypotheses]. We therefore propose that the
development of <em>some</em> coastal MCSs can be attributed to an
intensification of upwelling. The origin of MHWs at any scale seems
conceptually straight forward: they may result directly from
atmosphere-ocean heat transfer as in the Mediterranean Sea [e.g.
Garrabou2009] and from advection, i.e., the transport of warm water
due to currents such as what happened off Western Australia in 2011
[Feng2013; Benthuysen2014], the NW Atlantic in 2012 [Mills2012;
Chen2014; Chen2015] and potentially off SE Australia in 2016. In a
world that is warming, their intensity and frequency are increasing
over time relative to a long-term climatology. Since MHWs and MCSs
are both able to effect ecosystem change, a mechanistic understanding
of their drivers will be invaluable. To this end our study serves as
a constructive first step to understand the prevalence of anomalous
thermal events with respect to forcing mechanisms at different
scales.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hobday2016 applied their MHW
framework to 1 ⁄ 4 ° NOAA optimally interpolated sea surface
temperature data [hereafter referred to as OISST; Reynolds2007], but
warned users to be cognisant that different data sets would provide
different kinds of information pertaining to heatwaves. Our study
applies this MHW (MCS) definition to datasets of coastal <em>in situ</em>
(local-scale) and offshore gridded OISST (broad-scale) temperature
time series collected at different locations along coastlines
influenced by contrasting ocean currents — the Benguela Current, an
eastern boundary upwelling system, and the Agulhas Current — and
locally modified by regional aspects of the coastal bathymetry and
geomorphology and other smaller scale coastal features. These
systems, assessed within a framework that couples local- and
broad-scale features, permit us to assess how MHWs (MCSs) develop in
coastal regions. Specifically, we aim to assess the significance of
MHWs (MCSs) within the context of the datasets’ inherent
differences, and examine the various dynamical properties that then
emerge out of the regional oceanographic context and out of the
local-scale modifications of the regional ocean features as they
approach the coast. In doing so, we wish to provide some insights
into possible mechanisms that determine the nature and origin of MHWs
(MCSs) within regionally distinct ocean/coastal sections. Our
predictions are that i) local coastal MHW events are coupled with
offshore broad-scale thermal patterns; ii) MCSs originate at the
local scale in the coastal <em>in situ</em> dataset as isolated
incidents decoupled from broader-scale patterns; iii) different
coastal sections, each variously influenced by interactions between
local- and broad-scale processes, display different dynamics (timing,
frequency, duration and intensity) of MHWs and MCSs; and iv) the
frequency of warm (cold) events will increase (decrease) with time
under a regime of climate change. The possibility of atmospheric
forcing on coastal events is considered a very likely possibility but
it was not assessed within the scope of this study.</p>
<h1><a name="methods"></a>2. Methods</h1>
<h2 class="western"><a name="study-region"></a>2.1. Study region</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The variety of oceanographic features
around the <em>ca</em>. 2,700 km long South African coast provides a
natural testing bed for the potential effects of different ocean
forcing mechanisms on the occurrence of MHWs and MCSs. Annual mean (±
standard deviation, hereafter referred to as SD) coastal seawater
temperatures range from 12.3±1.2C at the western limit near the
Namibian border (Site 1) to 24.4±2.0C in the east near the
Mozambican border (Site 21), and our study sites were selected to
cover this full range ([Figure1). We classify the coast into three
regions based on their major oceanographic features, their
temperature characteristics, and aspects of the underlying
continental shelf. The first is the west coast region dominated by
the Benguela Current, which forms an Eastern Boundary Upwelling
System (EBUS) [Hutchings2009]. Seasonal upwelling is maintained by
prevailing south-easterly trade winds. Evenly low temperatures are
especially noticeable at upwelling cells over a relatively narrow
continental shelf in the region northwards of the Cape Peninsula to
Cape Columbine. The west coast defines a cool temperate regime, with
the range of monthly mean temperatures at most sections intermediate
between cold temperate and warm temperate [Luning1990]. The second
region is the warm temperate [Luning1990] east coast where the
influence of the warm south-westerly flowing Agulhas Current, which
hugs tightly along the narrow continental shelf (except for the Natal
Bight), is strongly felt. This stretch of coast is spatially
homogeneous with respect to temperature and characterised by a
moderate amount of seasonal variation. Although the Agulhas Current
retroflects back into the southern Indian Ocean [Hutchings2009] just
south of the much wider and cooler Agulhas Bank [Roberts2005], its
influence regularly extends as far west as False Bay (Sites 5–21;
[Figure1). The third coastal region is that overlying the Agulhas
Bank. Although also warm temperate, it experiences a much larger
range in annual temperature and variability compared the west and
east coast regions, which is in part influenced by the retention and
cooling of Agulhas Current water on the bank, the presence of some
current-driven upwelling cells along this coastal section (Sites
15–17) [Roberts2005], and because of the effects of embayments and
capes throughout the region.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="temperature-data"></a>2.2. Temperature
data</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We use two sources of seawater
temperature data. The first dataset is comprised of 127 records of <em>in
situ</em> temperature records of daily measurements for up to 40
years in duration with a mean duration of <em>ca</em>. 19 years.
Whereas these <em>in situ</em> time series are generally shorter than
the recommended 30 year minimum for the characterisation of MHWs
[Hobday2016] and have some small amounts of missing data, it is our
opinion that the benefit of using <em>in situ</em> data over
satellite data is that they give a better representation of the
temperatures felt by coastal ecosystems as well as the thermal
characteristics near the coast, a region where satellite SST
measurements have been shown to perform poorly [e.g. Smale2009;
Castillo2010]. In a South African context, Smit2013 have shown that
satellite SST data display a warm bias as large as 6C over <em>in
situ</em> temperatures in the nearshore environment. In an attempt to
compromise between the proscribed requirements in Hobday2016 of a 30
year minimum and making use of this valuable dataset, all time series
under 10 years in duration were eliminated. We found 10 years to be
the minimum duration required in order to generate a robust estimate
of the climatology required for the identification of MHWs and MCSs.
Next, the remaining time series were further screened and those
missing more than 10% of their daily values were removed, leaving a
total of 21 time series. Care was taken to select continuous series
with as few as possible consecutive missing values, since having
regions in the data with more than two consecutive missing data
points interferes with the identification of the anomalous events
(see below). These stations were classified into three coastal
sections defined by properties of their oceanography and biogeography
Smit2013. Details on the selected time series, including location,
duration, and the coastal sections they were aggregated into may be
found in [TableS1] and the site localities are displayed spatially in
[Figure1].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The second set of temperature data
used in this study are the daily 1 ⁄ 4 ° NOAA optimally
interpolated sea surface temperature [OISST; Reynolds2007] derived
from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). To compare
the offshore mesoscale (OISST dataset) extreme events against those
along the coast (<em>in situ</em> dataset), shore-normal transects
were drawn from each of the 21 sites extending to the 200m isobath.
Temperature values from the OISST data were then extracted at each of
the roughly 25x25 km pixels along these transects, shown as black
boxes in [Figure1]. Where the shelf was less than 25 km wide (Sites
17–21) the nearest ‘ocean pixel’ to the <em>in situ</em> time
series coordinate was used. It was decided to use mean temperatures
along these shore-normal transects as they better represent the
mesoscale temperatures we were interested in comparing against the
coastal events, rather than simply using the nearest OISST pixel, as
this would only draw a comparison between the two different data
types at the coast, and not the mesoscale activity in the ocean. The
individual time series within each pixel of each transects were then
averaged to create 21 time series to match against those calculated
for the <em>in situ</em> sites. These 21 OISST time series could then
be analysed for MHWs (MCSs) in the same way as the <em>in situ</em>
data (see below). Note that the OISST time series had valid data
covering 1982–2015 which did not match exactly the coverage by
individual <em>in situ</em> sites.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="defining-and-calculating-mhws-and-mcss"></a>
2.3. Defining and calculating MHWs and MCSs</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">MHWs are defined here following
Hobday2016 as “discrete prolonged anomalously warm water events in
a particular location.” MCS are defined in the same manner as MHWs
with the exception of being “anomalously cold water events”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, a climatological mean and 90th
and 10th percentiles were calculated for each day of the year by
pooling all data within an 11-day window across all years. MHWs
(MCSs) were detected as periods of time when temperatures exceeded
(fell below) the 90th (10th) percentile for at least five days. The
implication was therefore that MHWs (MCSs) could develop outside of
the warm (cold) season (i.e. winter (summer) months). Since our <em>in
situ</em> time series were of differing durations we calculated the
climatology over all available years; in the case of the OISST data,
climatologies were calculated over a fixed 33-year base period
(1982–2015). Furthermore, discrete events with well-defined start
and end dates but with ‘breaks’ between events lasting &lt;=2
days followed by subsequent &gt;=5 day events were considered as
continuous events. After the events were defined, a set of metrics
([Table1]) were calculated including maximum and mean intensity
(measured as anomalies relative to the climatological mean, in C),
duration (time from start to end dates, in days), and cumulative
intensity (the integrated intensity over the duration of the event,
analogous to degree-heating-days, in C). Although MCS intensities are
calculated as negative values (i.e. anomalies) they are reported in
the text as absolute values.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A Python script
[https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves; see Hobday2016] was
used to calculate the individual MHWs for both the <em>in situ</em>
and OISST time series. The script was modified to permit the
calculation of MCSs. After the individual events were recorded, mean
annual values for the metrics seen in [Table1] were created for each
year of each times series. This provided two different sets of
measurements for the extreme events that will be referred to
specifically throughout this paper. ‘Annual’ data refer to the
annual means of events for each year of each time series whereas
‘event’ data refer to the individually calculated events within
each time series.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Because MHWs (MCSs) are calculated
relative to percentile exceedances, rather than absolute definitions
such as periods with temperatures above an arbitrary fixed
temperature threshold, any time of year could be shown to be
experiencing a MHW (MCS). This is an important consideration as
unusually warm waters occurring during the winter months of a year,
the time when many species need cold water for effective
spawning/spore release, can have a negative effect on the recruitment
success of that population for the year [Wernberg2011].</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="detecting-co-occurrence-of-coastal-and-offshore-events"></a>
2.4. Detecting co-occurrence of coastal and offshore events</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In order to better understand the
potential impact mesoscale phenomena have on coastal events, the
proportion of co-occurring MHWs (MCSs) found between the two datasets
was calculated for each time series. This was initially done by
taking each event (warm and cold) within an <em>in situ</em> time
series and looking for an event occurring within the OISST time
series at the same site within a certain period of time before the <em>in
situ</em> date. These co-occurrence proportions were used to describe
how often the mesoscale oceanography off the coast led the extreme
events occurring along the coast. All events occurring on dates
outside of the dates occurring within the matching time series were
removed from this calculation. The sum of events found to occur
within the same time frame was then divided by the total number of <em>in
situ</em> events that occurred during the time period shared with the
OISST data (which varies from station to station) to produce a
co-occurrence proportion. The proportions of co-occurrence were then
recalculated controlling for the size of the lag window used when
comparing the two different datasets for concurrent events, as well
as the directionality used for this comparison. In other words, a
range of window sizes from 2-14 were used for each site to see how
far apart events generally occurred and the lag period used was also
applied only after the <em>in situ</em> date, as well as both before
and after the date, effectively doubling the range of the lag. This
allowed us to see how often the <em>in situ</em> event led the
mesoscale event as well as seeing broadly the amounts of
co-occurrence occurring between the two data sets.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides controlling for the duration
and direction of lag, the size of the events themselves (ranked by
cumulative intensity) was compared. This was accomplished by
controlling the pool of events with which to compare the datasets per
site in steps of 10th percentiles. This progressively removed smaller
events until only the larger events were being compared. This allowed
us to track the co-occurrence of only the largest events, reducing
the overall proportion of co-occurrence found within each site as
caused by the smaller events occurring at similar times as large
events.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The top three MHWs (MCSs) for each <em>in
situ</em> and OISST time series as defined by cumulative intensity
were also noted in order to visually compare the co-occurrence of
events in detail, both within and between the different datasets.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Given that the anthropogenic forcing
of climate change is predicted to increase the temperature of most of
the ocean over time, it stands to reason that, as a function of the
90th and 10th percentiles, one would expect to see the larger MHWs
near the end of the time series, and the larger MCSs near the
beginning. This can be tracked visually by looking at the top three
warm and cold events for each time series. Given that the OISST time
series are greater than 30 years in duration it is possible to
discern the long term trends within the data apart from the noise of
any inter-decadal patterns (Schlegel and Smit, in review). Using a
simple linear model, the decadal trend in the annual occurrence of
MHWs and MCSs was calculated for all of the OISST data as well as the
<em>in situ</em> time series that were over 30 years long. The
shorter time series simply had the proportion of MHWs or MCSs in the
first half of the time series compared against those in the second
half to show if there were more or fewer.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="event-metrics"></a>3.1. Event metrics</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Looking for differences in the
metrics of MHWs and MCSs between datasets and between coasts
([Table2]), a series of general linear hypotheses [Hothorn2008]
revealed significant differences in the frequency of MHWs and MCSs
between the <em>in situ</em> and OISST datasets, with the OISST
dataset displaying more events of each kind (MHWs: <em>t</em>=-5.37,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01; MCSs: <em>t</em>=-5.28, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01). The
number of hot events is neither more nor less than the number of cold
events irrespective of dataset analysed. Considering the difference
in number of MHWs or MCSs between coasts, differences were not found
for the <em>in situ</em> nor the OISST datasets.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">MHWs and MCSs detected in the OISST
dataset are of longer duration than in the <em>in situ</em> dataset
(MHWs: <em>t</em>=-2.34, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05; MCSs: <em>t</em>=-3.31,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01). Comparing coasts within the <em>in situ</em>
dataset, cold events are shorter along the east than along the south
(<em>t</em>=5.41, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) or west coasts (<em>t</em>=2.06,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.05); the warm events show the same response, with the
duration along the east coast being shorter than along the south
(<em>t</em>=3.79, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) or west (<em>t</em>=2.67,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01) coasts. MCSs are also of shorter duration along
the east coast compared to the south coast in the OISST dataset
(<em>t</em>=2.83, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01), while MHWs follow the same
pattern that emerged in the <em>in situ</em> data (east <em>vs.</em>
south: <em>t</em>=6.01, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01; east <em>vs.</em> west:
<em>t</em>=3.79, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01). Contrasting the duration of
MHWs with that of MCSs within coast and dataset, the duration of the
two event types is identical, except for in the OISST dataset along
the east coast where cold events last longer (<em>t</em>=-2.70,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The <em>in situ</em> dataset yielded
more intense MHWs (<em>t</em>=19.80, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) and MCSs
(<em>t</em>=14.19, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) than the OISST dataset.
Looking at the difference in intensity of events within dataset, MCSs
are more intense than MHWs in the OISST dataset (<em>t</em>=-4.10,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01). There are also differences in the intensity of
MHWs and MCSs between coasts within a dataset. Considering the <em>in
situ</em> data, the intensity of event types is greater along the
south coast for both MHWs (south <em>vs.</em> east: <em>t</em>=-2.58,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01; south <em>vs.</em> west: <em>t</em>=3.28, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01)
and MCSs (south <em>vs.</em> east: <em>t</em>=5.48, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01;
south <em>vs.</em> west: <em>t</em>=-6.66, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01). More
intense MCSs were detected in the OISST dataset on the south coast
compared to the east (<em>t</em>=-2.15, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05), while
MHWs were less intense along the east compared to the south (<em>t</em>=3.01,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01) or west (<em>t</em>=2.18, <em>p</em>&lt;0.05)
coasts. Focussing on differences between coasts but within a dataset,
MHWs emerging from the <em>in situ</em> dataset are more intense than
their cold counterparts along the west (<em>t</em>=4.48, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01)
and east (<em>t</em>=3.06, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) coasts, but MCS are
more intense compared to MHWs along the south coast (<em>t</em>=-5.66,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01). A coastal difference in intensity of cold and
warm events is only seen along the east coast (<em>t</em>=-4.36,
<em>p</em>&lt;0.01) in the OISST dataset.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The mean annual statistics shown in
[Table2] give a broad overview of the events occurring along the
coast; however, examining the largest MHWs and MCSs better aids in
our understanding of which coastal sections show the most intense
events. The ranking of these events is based on the cumulative
intensity metric as explained in [Table1]. To calculate the mean
cumulative intensity of all events it was necessary to use the
individual event data, and not the annual mean data used for
[Table2]. Doing so for MHWs from both datasets we see that there is a
significant difference (<em>t</em>=7.68, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) in the
mean (±SD) cumulative intensities with the <em>in situ</em> dataset
(26.11±24.37C⋅days) having greater cumulative intensities than the
the OISST dataset (18.65±15.10C⋅days). The absolute mean (±SD)
MCS cumulative intensities between the two datasets are also
significantly different (<em>t</em>=2.99, <em>p</em>&lt;0.01) with
the <em>in situ</em> events (26.45±24.25C⋅days) being greater than
the the OISST events (23.17±23.49C⋅days).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><b>Table 2:</b> The mean (±SD)
values for event count, duration and mean intensity from the annual
data for MHWs and MCSs for each coastal section as calculated from
the <em>in situ</em> (A) and OISST (B) time series. The
aforementioned annual data were averaged across all years for all
time series within each respective coast to produce the mean values
shown. Lower case letters indicate if any of the coastal sections
differ <em>within</em> the same dataset <em>and</em> event type, with
metrics sharing the same letter being statistically indistinguishable
from one-another. For example, one may see that the duration of MHWs
on the east coast in the <em>in situ</em> data are significantly
shorter than MHWs on the west and south coasts, which are not
significantly different from one another in length. The upper case
letters indicate if the coastal sections differ <em>between</em> the
datasets, but <em>within</em> coast <em>and</em> event type. For
example, one may see that the count of MCSs on the west and east
coasts are not significantly different whereas the count of MCSs on
the south coast in the OISST dataset is significantly greater than in
the <em>in situ</em> dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The three largest MHWs that occur
within the <em>in situ</em> dataset are all on the south coast
([Table3]). The cumulative intensity of the south coast events is
greater than those along the west coast, with the largest three MHWs
from the east coast being the smallest. This is due in part to the
events on the south coast having a greater duration than the other
two coastal sections, which influences the cumulative intensity
metric. As with the MHWs, the largest three MCSs from the <em>in situ</em>
data are also on the south coast ([Table3]). The west coast has the
next largest three events and the east coast the smallest. The south
coast MCSs have a greater duration than the MCSs from the other
coastal sections, but are less pronounced than that of the MHWs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The pattern seen in the <em>in situ</em>
data of the largest MHWs and MCSs occurring on the south, west and
east coasts respectively is not repeated with the OISST dataset.
Whereas the single largest MHW occurs on the south coast in the OISST
data, the three largest MHWs from the west coast are larger than the
second and third largest events from the south coast ([Table3]). The
three largest MHWs from the east coast are again smaller than those
from the other coasts. Assigning the largest MCSs from the OISST
dataset to either the south or west coasts is not possible due to an
inconsistent pattern here. The east coast MCSs from the OISST dataset
are however consistent in that they are again comprised of the
smallest three events. All of the coastal sections in the OISST
dataset show that at least two of their largest MCSs occurred at the
same time at different sites. This is a level of co-occurrence that
the <em>in situ</em> data do not show.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A three-way ANOVA on the individual
event data for both the <em>in situ</em> and OISST data combined
(i.e. as with the annual data) with three factors (coast, event type,
dataset) yielded significant marginal effects and interactions
between all factors (<em>p&lt;=</em>0.03).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As well as having significantly
different cumulative intensities, we see in [Figure2] that the three
largest events occurring for each time series within the OISST
dataset are often different from those seen in the <em>in situ</em>
dataset, but show a greater amount of co-occurrence with events
detected at neighbouring coastal stations than the corresponding <em>in
situ</em> time series do.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="co-occurrence-rates"></a>3.3.
Co-occurrence rates</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The proportion of co-occurrence found
for MHWs and MCSs between the datasets for each site may be seen in
[Figure4] and [Figure5] respectively. When using the lag windows
before and after the <em>in situ</em> event and comparing all events
we see that as the width of the lag window increases from 2 to 14
days the mean proportion of co-occurrence for all sites increases
linearly for MHWs (0.09 to 0.38) and MCSs (0.10 to 0.30). Using these
same constraints we see that south coast sites have the largest mean
increase in co-occurrence for MHWs (0.10 to 0.45) and MCSs (0.11 to
0.34), whereas the west coast sites show the smallest increase for
MHWs (0.07 to 0.28) and MCSs (0.08 to 0.19). With all variables
controlled for in the same manner, the co-occurrence rates between
the different coastal sections are not significantly different for
MHWs or MCSs at 2 day nor 14 day lags (<em>p&gt;=</em>0.12).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The directionality of the lag window
also affects the co-occurrence of events. Comparing all events within
a 14 day lag window before the <em>in situ</em> event gives higher
mean (±SD) rates of co-occurrence for MHWs (0.22±0.13) than for the
same lag window after the <em>in situ</em> event for MHWs
(0.18±0.10). This same comparison for MCSs shows that the lag window
before the <em>in situ</em> event (0.16±0.09) has slightly lower
rates of co-occurrence than the lag window after the <em>in situ</em>
event (0.17±0.08). When the smaller events were screened from
comparison and only the largest half of the events used (50<sup>th</sup>
percentile), the difference in mean (±SD) co-occurrence proportions
for MHWs event lessens at 0.16±011 before the <em>in situ</em> event
and 0.15±0.12 after. The mean (±SD) co-occurrence proportion of
MCSs at this level is less when using a lag window before the <em>in
situ</em> event at 0.05±0.08 than for a lag window after at
0.08±0.08.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is no co-occurrence for the
largest MCSs between the datasets, whereas four of the 21 time series
show co-occurrence for their most extreme MHWs ([Figure4]).
Interestingly, all four time series are on the south coast and three
of the four show co-occurrence for their largest MHW when the <em>in
situ</em> event preceded the OISST event.</p>

Decadal trends in MHWs and MCSs</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In order to calculate the decadal
trends in MHW and MCS count, linear models were fitted to the annual
count values for each &gt;30 year time series. The slope of this line
indicates whether after &gt;30 years MHWs/MCSs are increasing or
decreasing. As the OISST data set is over 30 years in duration,
decadal trends were calculated for each OISST time series as seen in
[Table4]. We see that the mean (±SD) decadal trend for MHW
occurrence in the OISST dataset is 0.5±0.3 dec<sup>−1</sup> across
all sites and -0.7±0.6 dec<sup>−1</sup> for MCSs. The decadal
trends in MHW occurrence increase as one moves from the colder
Benguela fed west coast to warmer Agulhas driven east coast with the
mean (±SD) decadal MHW trend on the west coast being 0.3±0.3 dec<sup>−1</sup>,
the south coast being 0.5±0.3 dec<sup>−1</sup> and the east coast
at 0.6±0.2 dec<sup>−1</sup>. Just as MHWs are occurring more
frequently per decade on the east coast than the west, the frequency
of MCSs is decreasing more on the east coast than the west. The
decadal trend in MCSs on the west coast is -0.1±0.6 dec<sup>−1</sup>,
-0.8±0.5 dec<sup>−1</sup> on the south coast and -0.9±0.2 dec<sup>−1</sup>
on the east coast. Note however that very few of the decadal trends
detected in these data where significant.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Of the 21 <em>in situ</em> time
series, only four of them reach the &gt;30 year requirement
([Table4]). Of these four time series the mean (±SD) decadal trend
for MHWs is 0.3±0.5 dec<sup>−1</sup> and -0.1±0.5 dec<sup>−1</sup>
for MCSs. There are two sites from the west coast and two from the
south, excluding the east coast from a possible calculation of
decadal change for <em>in situ</em> MHWs and MCSs. The mean (±SD)
decadal trend for MHWs (MCSs) on the west coast is 0.1±0.5 dec<sup>−1</sup>
(-0.2±0.7 dec<sup>−1</sup>) and 0.5±0.5 dec<sup>−1</sup>
(0.1±0.4 dec<sup>−1</sup>) on the south.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For the remaining 17 <em>in situ</em>
time series we cut each one in half and calculated the sum of the
annual count of both warm and cold events for each half. By dividing
the sum of either MHWs or MCSs in the second half of each time series
by the same type of event in the first half, we produced proportional
values that could be used to compare the total number of events
against, within and between each coastal section. Using another
series of general linear hypotheses [Hothorn2008] we then tested the
significant differences between the count data in the first and
second halves of the time series for the overall count of MHWs and
MCSs as well as each coastal section. The mean (±SD) proportion of
MHWs occurring in the second half of the shorter time series was
1.7±1.3 (<em>p</em>=0.37) and that of MCSs was 0.8±0.6(<em>p</em>=0.39),
neither being significantly different. The counts for both MHWs and
MCSs between the first and second halves of the time series for the
west and south coasts were significantly different. Showing agreement
with the longer time series, the short west coast time series had
significantly more MHWs in the second half at 1.5±0.6 (<em>p</em>=0.03),
but it differed from the longer time series by having more MCSs in
the second half at 1.8±0.6 (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01). The short south

both MHWs with a proportion of 2.1±1.4 (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01) and MCSs
with a proportion of 0.5±0.3 (<em>p</em>&lt;0.01). The short east

short time series was 0.7±0.4 (<em>p</em>=0.10) and the proportion
of MCSs was 1.0±0.8 (<em>p</em>=0.57).</p>

Offshore MHWs and MCSs</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When one languidly casts their gaze
away from the coast and out towards the boundless expanse of ocean
around southern Africa the mesoscale patterns as they occur
independent of the continent may be more readily seen. [Figure6]
shows the mean count, duration and intensity of each pixel from the
OISST dataset as derived from the annual data. The most MHWs occur
well south of the tip of the continent whereas some of the most
frequent MCS activity may be found directly against the west coast.
This helps to explain the finding that MHWs were shown to be longer
and more intense in the <em>in situ</em> dataset, whereas the OISST
dataset shows MCSs to be longer and more intense. As for the duration
of events, it is clear from [Figure6] that the MHWs and MCSs detected
in the Agulhas current are relatively short-lived. Almost all of the
pixels that show events in the upper range of the durations detected
occur well away from the coast, too. This explains why the events in
the <em>in situ</em> data have a greater duration. As for the
intensity of offshore events, the west and south coasts are shown to
have centres of intensity very near the shore whereas the east coast
generally does not. The most intense events detected in the OISST
data are found along or south of the south coast, corroborating the
finding that the south coast has the greatest proportion of
co-occurrence amongst the three coastal sections.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Whereas the mean frequency, duration
and intensity of MHWs and MCSs offshore are telling, the picture is
not complete without also considering the trend in these metrics,
too. We see in [Figure7] that the frequency, duration and intensity
of MHWs have almost exclusively been increasing throughout the
studied regions of the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The frequency of
MCS has been decreasing most rapidly along the coast of southern
Africa with a couple of notable exceptions near Port Elizabeth and
north of the Cape Peninsula where the frequency of MCSs has been
increasing very near to the coast. The duration of MCSs is seen to
generally increase further offshore with most of the nearshore region
changing little or decreasing. The intensity of MCSs is either
changing little near the coast or is increasing dramatically, as seen
in the dark blue spot north of the Cape Peninsula in the “MCS
Intensity (mean) Trend” panel in [Figure7]. This means that a
consistent &gt;30 year trend in extreme cold events, more so than
anywhere else in this region of the ocean, has been acting on the
coastal waters here.</p>

<h1><a name="discussion"></a>4. Discussion</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Our results clearly show that MHWs
and MCSs detected in two different ocean temperature datasets display
markedly differing metrics regarding the events’ timing, frequency,
duration and intensity. These differences appear to be related to the
nature and variability of physical oceanographic processes at broad-
and local-scales, and the coupling of the processes across these
scales. These finding illustrate how a study of the properties of
anomalous events can provide novel insights into drivers of the
thermal regime along coastlines, and can be used to arrive at a some
mechanistic insights into the nature and origin of MHWs (MCSs), which
under a regime of climate change will become the major mode of
perturbation to marine ecosystems and the marine living resources and
coupled ecosystem services we derive from these systems. This
analysis would not have been possible had it not been for the recent
framework of Hobday2016, which has enabled the calculation of
objective, quantitative metrics for the comparison of anomalous
thermal events across scales, location and time. However, Hobday2016
noted that their definition does not make assumptions about the
drivers of heatwaves, nor does it hint at any ecological effects. We
also draw no conclusions about the consequences of the events
detected in our study, but we show how a careful analysis of events
in contrasting datasets may shed information on the underlying
drivers of those events.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="relation-between-local--and-broad-scale-mhws-and-mcss"></a>
4.1. Relation between local- and broad-scale MHWs and MCSs</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The difference between the <em>in
situ</em> and OISST datasets is striking. We anticipated a large
degree of coupling between the anomalously warm events manifesting in
datasets that encapsulate local- and broad-scale patterns, as
represented by the <em>in situ</em> and OISST datasets, respectively.
We found instead that the broad-scale dataset yields heatwaves that
are more frequent and longer in duration, but less intense than its
local-scale counterpart. Cold-spells, for which we expected a greater
deal of decoupling between local- and broad-scale manifestations,
indeed show evidence of such lack of coupling. MCSs are more
frequently seen and last longer in the OISST data; however, the mean
intensity of MCSs at the broad-scale is lower than at the coast.
Furthermore, there is no difference in the frequency of MHWs and MCSs
emerging at the two scales, but the duration and intensity of MHWs
relative to MCSs across scale are modified by the section of the
coast in which they occur. Taken at face value, these finding might
suggest that both MHWs and MCSs are completely decoupled between
coastal and offshore regions. A more in-depth assessment of the rates
of coupling is provided later (see <em>Co-occurrence rates</em>,
below), and it shows that <em>some</em> coupling is indeed present,
particularly in MHWs. Another consideration for the apparent lack of
relation between these datasets is that the OISST temperatures are
collected at the surface and though they are converted from a “skin”
temperature (roughly a micron deep) to a “bulk” temperature
(roughly half a metre deep) [Reynolds2007], this is still much
shallower than the temperatures recorded in the <em>in situ</em>
data, which are generally recorded within several metres from the
surface. However, that we have compared these deeper <em>in situ</em>
data to OISST data averaged across the width of the continental shelf
at each site, and not simply to the nearest available pixel, should
largely address any inconsistencies in temperature caused by
mismatches in depth as mixed layer of the mesoscale temperature
patterns of the open ocean should reach deeper than several metres.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">An important outcome emerging from
the above analysis is that the OISST dataset shows many weak events
occurring often whereas the <em>in situ</em> dataset shows fewer but
more intense events. The interaction between frequency and duration
is an important consideration, because this influences the cumulative
intensity metric. This indeed emerges in mean cumulative intensities
calculated for the MHWs and MCSs, which are highest in the <em>in
situ</em> data. Events near the coast are more intense overall.
Heatwaves are ubiquitous throughout the world’s oceans, but if this
pattern of intensification of anomalous events at the coast holds
true for different world regions, it creates interesting challenges
for the management of marine living resources and ecosystems at the
coast. The impact humans have on coastal ecosystems only exacerbates
this looming threat. Over half of the world’s countries have
80-100% of their populations living within 100km of the coastline,
where 21 of the largest 33 cities are also found and the population
density of these coastal human aggregations is increasing much faster
than anywhere else on the planet [Martinez2007]. This increasing
burden may be accelerating the decadal rate of warming seen in
coastal waters [Amos2013], which would then likely further increase
the already greater cumulative intensity of the coastal MHWs over
those seen further offshore.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Of the metrics presented in this
paper, cumulative intensity (C⋅days) is perhaps the most important
ecologically. As a product of the intensity and duration of an event,
cumulative intensity may be used as an index to measure the threat of
extreme events to coastal ecosystems. Research conducted on the
damaging effects of extreme events [e.g. Wernberg2013] record the
cumulative temperature above the seasonal average experienced by the
coastal ecosystem in question. As the body of research on extreme
events increases, we think that these cumulative intensity values may
be used to establish a global index of the thresholds for different
ecosystems at which ecological perturbations, impairment or
destruction has occurred. Combined with near real time monitoring,
this metric may then be used to improve the decision making process
on how when and how best to respond to unusually warm or cold bodies
of water.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We see that a large number of the
events occurring between these two datasets are unrelated and that
some other influence(s) may be having a more pronounced effect on the
temperatures experienced at the coast than the ocean temperatures
offshore. This conclusion is important in the light of the findings
of Smit2013, who found that there is a very strong mismatch in the
temperatures recorded by thermal loggers installed <em>in situ</em>
at the coast (i.e. local-scale) compared to the measurement of the
ocean’s temperature from space (i.e. broad-scale). That study
showed biases of up to +6 C between the same local-scale dataset used
here and AVHRR and MODIS Terra SST, with a strong spatial pattern.
The insight emerging from the present study is that there are not
only spatial influences affecting the mismatch between local- and
broad-scale thermal patterns, but that there is a temporal component
to these biases too. In other words, it is not possible to apply a
constant and simple bias adjustment to the <em>in situ</em> and SST
time series used by Smit2013. Such a deterioration of the offshore
thermal signal in coastal waters is known to occur due to the local
modifications of nearshore circulation patterns by headlands,
embayments, influences of the bathymetry and other such perturbations
that introduce eddies and fronts and a shoaling of the thermocline
[Okubo1973; Pingree1979; Wolanski1988; Black1990; Grundlingh1991;
Graham1997]. These processes are by no means yet fully understood,
and our understanding of physical oceanographic process remains
weighted toward the mesoscale, as was noted by Graham1997 in the
light of their study on upwelling shadows, another process
responsible for the local modification of a phenomenon that is
generally studied at the broad-scale. These local-scale deviations
are know to affect coastal ecological processes, such as the
transport, dispersal and settlement of larvae [Pineda1994;
McCulloch2003; Narvaez2004] and the dynamics of phytoplankton and
nutrient delivery [Graham1997; Pineda1994], and it is likely that
thermal patterns over similar scales will also have local
significance for the biology of the nearshore region.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="mhws-and-mcss-in-different-coastal-sections"></a>
4.2. MHWs and MCSs in different coastal sections</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Meaningful patterns of event metrics
also emerge between coasts. The number of anomalously warm or cold
events between coasts is not influenced by whether we are looking at
coastal or offshore regions. Each coastal section is thus equally
prone to experience a MHW or a MCS. Differences emerge in a
comparison of the duration and intensity metrics, however. The east
coast differs from the other two coastal sections in that MHWs and
MCSs at both the local- and broad-scale are of shortest duration
here; however, comparing the event duration between events, we see
that in this region the cold spells last longer than heatwaves.
Furthermore, the east coast also displays the least intense MHWs but
most intense MCSs of any coastal region along offshore portions of
South Africa’s coastline. This stretch of coastline is heavily
influenced by the warm Agulhas Current, separated from the coast only
by a very narrow and steep continental shelf, which abruptly expands
into the &gt;200km wide Agulhas Bank south of Port Alfred
([Figure1]). This narrow continental slope margin allows upwelling on
the shoreward side of the Agulhas Current to occur along the entire
length of the east coast, independent of local atmospheric conditions
[Lutjeharms2000]. It is therefore possible that this constant forcing
of the Agulhas current on the east coast would cause the events
arising there to dissipate more quickly and return to a ‘normal,’
less variable state. This seems to be a plausible explanation for why
the largest events, both hot and cold, recorded on the east coast are
so much smaller than those along the other two coastal sections. We
suggest that the hydrodynamic properties of the Agulhas Current have
prevented any prolonged temperature events from persisting. Contrary
to this conclusion it is the clear from the literature that some of
the largest documented heatwaves have been caused by anomalously high
heat content of ocean currents, such as the Leeuwin Current in the
case of the Western Australia MHW [Feng2013; Pearce2013;
Wernberg2013]. Conversely, large MHWs such as that documented in the
north west Atlantic Ocean in 2012 have been shown to be coupled
strongly with atmospheric phenomena [Mills2012; Chen2014; Chen2015].
Therefore, while no extreme MHWs or MCSs have yet occurred on the
east coast, the potential exists for some further-afield phenomenon
to cause such an event here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The south coast is fundamentally
different from the other coastal sections in that it is dominated not
by one strong current, such as the Agulhas or Benguela Currents, but
rather consists of a broad continental shelf on which the interplay
of these two currents form an ephemeral ‘mixing-pot’ between two
oceans, as well as hosting an attendant array of complex coastal
processes that modify the already thermally variable waters overlying
the Agulhas Bank [Lutjeharms2003; Roberts2005; Hutchings2009].
Consequently this section of coastline has some of the most variable
thermal regimes along the entire South African coastline. Some of the
<em>in situ</em> time series here are recorded in relatively shallow
embayments, allowing for thermal heating to have a marked effect
there — as is indeed seen in the cumulative intensities for MHWs in
False Bay — and further offshore sheer-edge forcing creates eddies
resulting from the departure of the Agulhas Current from the Agulhas
Bank that may then be projected across the shelf [Lutjeharms2003].
Such high temperature events last longer, and even if their mean
intensities are lower, this contributes towards their high cumulative
intensities there. The significantly more intense MCSs on the south
coast are attributed to the much greater mean intensity of events
around Tsitsikamma (Sites 12–14). Without these three sites the
MCSs on the south coast are not significantly greater than those
along the other two coastal sections. [Roberts2005] hypothesised that
a wind forced upwelling cell occurs near Tsitsikamma and the mean
intensity of the events recorded here seems to support this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The west coast does not show
exceptional patterns in MHW and MCS metrics. At first glance, we were
surprised to find that the mean intensity of west coast (EBUS)
coastal MCSs is lower than those on the south coast. Upwelling
systems are defined by periodic occurrences of cold water of deep
origin near the coast [Lutjeharms2000; Hutchings2009] and it seems
intuitive to associate these with the cold-spells. But cold upwelled
water <em>defines</em> the climatology for the region, and for a cold
spell to manifest in an upwelling region the temperature of that
water would have to be colder than the 90th percentile based on a
30-year climatological baseline period and would have to last for
five or more days. Accordingly, upwelling events that occur within a
seasonally predictable cycle are not extreme in nature, and are
therefore likely not flagged as MCSs. An upwelling event would need
to be a-seasonal in its occurrence to be recorded as a MCS. This is
certainly possible however, the very nature of the required
a-seasonality of MCSs obfuscates which phenomena may potentially be
driving the extreme cold temperatures. This consideration casts doubt
on our thoughts to use MCSs as a means to detect the intensification
of upwelling, which is a plausible prediction in an age when Earth’s
climate gradually warms [Garcia-Reyes2015]. Results show that
offshore MCS are, on average, lasting significantly longer, occurring
significantly more often and the largest events are more intense. As
upwelling is known to occur along the coast here [Hutchings2009],
that the offshore MCSs occur more often and last longer is strong
evidence that the MCS algorithm is not a good proxy for upwelling
detection and that the coastal cold events detected here are likely
due to other factors. Upwelling events should have notable
properties, such as rate of onset and duration of peak intensity,
which set them apart from other events that may cause colder water to
occur at the surface. Further work on the definition of the
characteristics of upwelling events could be coupled with the MCS
algorithm for accurate use in upwelling detection in temperature time
series.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="patterns-in-mean-cumulative-intensity-1"></a>
4.3. Patterns in mean cumulative intensity</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The pattern of mean cumulative
intensity within the local-scale data is very clear in that warm and
cold events on the south coast are much more extreme than those along
the west and east coasts. The OISST data are less conclusive on
whether the south or west coast experiences the most extreme events,
but it is apparent from all of the analyses from both datasets that
the east coast experiences very few extreme MHWs or MCSs. These
findings suggest that the east coast is the most thermally stable of
the three coastal sections, and that MHWs or MCSs with mean
cumulative intensities that could potentially damage ecosystems are
least prone to develop there. It is the south coast region, however,
where coastal ecosystems are most at risk due to excessively warm
events.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Within the south coast (Sites 5–17),
the sites within False Bay (Sites 5–7) were found to have greater
cumulative intensities for MHWs and MCSs than the sites over the
Agulhas Bank (Sites 8–17). Whereas it has been shown here that the
Agulhas Bank experiences more thermal variation than the other two
coastal sections, False Bay, which is ~50 km across, is situated
within the transition zone between the Benguela and Agulhas Currents
[Smit2013] and contains the most variable time series in the entire
<em>in situ</em> dataset. Lower resolution satellite temperature
products, such as Pathfinder version 5.0, have been shown to
inadequately resolve the SST within the relatively small body of
water that is False Bay [Dufois2012]. Embayments such as this often
display thermal ranges (both temporally and spatially) large enough
to effect species range [Ling2009] and are of great ecological
[Klumb2003] and economic importance [Lugendo2005]. We think that such
regions are also more prone to MHWs (and perhaps MCSs) due to an even
stronger decoupling from broad-scale thermal patterns and drivers:
indeed, two of the three largest MHWs and MCSs detected in the
local-scale dataset were recorded within False Bay, whereas only one
large MHW and no MCSs were detected with the OISST dataset. This
illustrates the problem of using satellite temperature data for
coastal ecological applications, and emphasizes the need for more
comprehensive coverage of coastal ecosystems in long-term seawater
temperature monitoring programmes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although we are are generally
sceptical of use of most gridded SST product for coastal
applications, there are exceptions to this general ‘rule’ in
situations where a good deal of local knowledge of regional
oceanographic patterns and processes is available. Our example of the
discrepancies for the size of the events recorded in False Bay serves
to illustrate the usefulness of satellite SST data to detect events
near the coast. The aforementioned wind forced coastal upwelling cell
near Tsitsikamma (Sites 12–14) argued for by Roberts2005 being one
example. That these three sites show greater cumulative intensities
for MCSs than all but one time series from the OISST dataset may
support the hypothesis for the existence of such a coastal upwelling
cell. It is important to stress here, however, that the usefulness of
the SST product does not reside in its use in isolation, but that our
findings based on this product are compared and contrasted with
findings derived from an analysis of the local-scale set of data. We
also need to be aware that, as mentioned earlier, the current MCS
algorithm should not be taken as showing upwelling events <em>per se</em>
with any fidelity. Greater insight is necessary if hypotheses, like
the aforementioned one on upwelling, could be investigated in this
manner. This would be an intriguing use of the MCS algorithm if it
can be used to validate one of multiple competing hypotheses that as
of yet may not have been able to be tested in any other way. This
would however require additional data such as changes in salinity
and/ or nutrients, vertical velocity or wind speeds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another important consideration is
the co-occurrence of the events with the highest mean cumulative
intensity within and between datasets. As one may see in [Table3],
none of the top three MHWs or MCSs for any of the coastal sections
from the <em>in situ</em> dataset are the same. They are all
individually different events occurring at different times. The OISST
dataset tells an entirely different story in that all but one of the
coastal sections, for both MHWs and MCSs, have at least two of the
three top events occurring at the same time. This means that the
largest events detected in the OISST data occur over a broad area at
the same time, whereas the <em>in situ</em> events are isolated not
only in time, but also in the location in which they occur. This
further reinforces our conclusion that the events detected by the
different datasets are often intrinsically different from one
another.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="co-occurrence-rates-1"></a>4.4.
Co-occurrence rates</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Looking at lags that precede the <em>in
situ</em> events, the rates of co-occurrence for MCSs are much lower
than for MHWs ([Figure4] and [Figure5]). This shows that if these
events are indeed related, more MHWs are being caused by mesoscale
activity than MCSs, as was expected. This finding is supported
further by comparing the rates of co-occurrence for MCS lagged before
and after the <em>in situ</em> event occurred. More MCS from the
OISST data are shown to occur after the <em>in situ</em> events for
all coastal sections. This may suggest some local heat loss process,
perhaps related to atmospheric cold events, cooling the waters near
the coast, which then gradually with time spreads to waters further
offshore. Such localised coastal phenomena have been implicated for
several of the cold spells which have caused the mass mortality of
some marine species [e.g. Gunter1941; Firth2011]. The co-occurrence
rates of MHWs before and after the <em>in situ</em> events are
however similar. This implies that extreme heat events may be
propagating onshore from offshore mesoscale activity however, extreme
heat events originating near the coast and seeping offshore to affect
the thermal regime there appears to be equally possible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We also infer from the proportions of
co-occurrence for time series on the south coast, which are generally
much higher than at the other two coasts, that events are caused by
the much higher level of influence from mesoscale phenomena occurring
over the Agulhas Bank. We also see that there is a higher proportion
of co-occurrence for the larger MHWs and MCSs on the south coast when
a lag window after the <em>in situ</em> event is applied. This
supports the argument that events originating in the nearshore are
then propagating out onto the Agulhas Bank and affecting the
oceanography there more often than mesoscale events originating on
the Agulhas Bank are affecting the nearshore environment. The overall
low rate of co-occurrence for all three coastal sections reinforces
the argument that it is not the mesoscale phenomena of the open ocean
abutting the southern African landmass that are driving extreme
events in the nearshore.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The very low proportion of
co-occurrence between the datasets, and the decline in the proportion
as the smaller events are screened out is strong evidence against the
hypothesis that mesoscale activity, both warm and cold, is causing
nearshore extreme thermal events. The small increases in
co-occurrence for some sites as only larger events were compared does
imply that there is some relationship between the inshore and
offshore, but that some other variable (e.g. atmospheric forcing) may
be having a greater effect on inshore events.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="climate-change"></a>4.5. Climate change</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As MHWs and MCSs are temperature
related phenomena we would be remiss not to discuss the potential of
our findings in relation to climate change. The frequency of the MHWs
and MCSs that occur along the coast is less telling in this regard
than the trend in these events themselves. Although all but four of
the <em>in situ</em> time series used in this investigation are too
short to draw adequate conclusions on the decadal trends seen in MHWs
and MCSs, the OISST data are not. And as hypothesised these data show
positive decadal trends for MHWs and negative trends for MCSs. This
means that over the past 33 years of satellite observation along our
shore-normal transects, MHWs have been increasing every decade for
each coastal section while MCSs have been decreasing. Whereas the
literature surrounding the potential increase (decrease) of MHWs
(MCSs) in the ocean is still in its infancy, atmospheric scientists
have been investigating the shift in extreme events for over a
decade. Both historic and modelled research shows that climate change
is leading to an increase of extreme hot events in the atmosphere
[Easterling2000; Perkins2013], and decreasing extreme cold
[Meehl2004]. Therefore we are unsurprised to find the same pattern in
the ocean.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When one looks more broadly at the
ocean around southern Africa this pattern generally holds up. We see
in [Figure7] that the frequency, duration and intensity of MHWs have
almost exclusively increased throughout the studied regions of the
Indian and Atlantic oceans. The frequency of MCS has decreased most
rapidly along the coast of southern Africa with a couple of notable
exceptions near Port Elizabeth and north of the Cape Peninsula where
the frequency of MCSs is increasing very near to the coast. The
duration of MCSs is seen to generally increase further offshore with
most of the nearshore changing little or decreasing. The intensity of
MCSs is either changing little near the coast or is increasing
dramatically, as seen in the dark blue patch north of the Cape
Peninsula in the “MCS Intensity (mean) Trend” panel in [Figure7].
This means that a consistent &gt;30 year trend in extreme cold
events, more so than anywhere else in this region of the ocean, has
been acting on the coastal waters here. Investigations into the
impact this may have had on these ecosystems may produce interesting
findings in regards to the effect of climate change on ecosystems.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though less conclusive than the
trends calculated from the longer time series, similar patterns were
found in the shorter <em>in situ</em> time series as well. As the
algorithm used to calculate these events is based on percentiles, it
stands to reason that as the mean temperature of South Africa’s
coastal waters has been increasing by 0.1C per decade on average
since the early 1970s (Schlegel and Smit, in review), there will be
an increase in MHWs and a decrease in MCSs. The gradual mean increase
in temperature will cause the algorithm used here to be biased in its
detection of MHWs as time progresses simply because temperatures are
generally warmer in the later half of the time series therefore, the
chances of the algorithm detecting a MHW increases because the base
temperature from which the MHW will be fluctuating from will be
greater than the beginning of the time series. Ultimately, for the
species and ecosystems experiencing this increase in duress, the
semantic argument of the viability of percentiles provides little
solace.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although Hobday2016 provide caveats
regarding using event metrics across datasets, we nevertheless feel
that it would be informative to bring the heatwave metrics measured
along the South African south coast into context by comparing them
with MHWs from regions [see Hobday2016]. We see that at our coastal
locations, Muizenberg and Mossel Bay, heatwaves have <em>on average</em>
cumulative intensities ranging from 156.4 to 310.30 C⋅days, mean
intensities from 1.77 to 4.47 C and lasting from 35 to 98 days. The
two longest individual MHW events experienced by the Western
Australian reef system [Feng2013] had a cumulative intensity of 237
C⋅days, a mean intensity of 2.5 C and a duration of 95 days in
1999; and a cumulative intensity of 276 C⋅days, a mean intensity of
2.51 and a duration of 110 days (and ongoing at the time of their
analysis) in 2014. The 2012 MHW of the north west Atlantic
[Mills2012; Chen2014] had a cumulative intensity of 145 C⋅days and
mean intensity of 4.00 C over 56 days, while the subsequent 2012/2013
heatwave went to 443 C⋅days and a mean intensity of 2.59 C and
lasted for 187 days. Both of these MHWs were reported to have had
major ecological consequences [Feng2013; Mills2012; Chen2014], but no
investigations have yet been done to see if similar negative effects
have taken place at the sites where we have recorded intense
heatwaves locally. Probably none have occurred as evidence for such
do not exist amongst the fisheries survey data collected annually,
but a more detailed investigation is warranted to see if <em>some</em>
of the ecological changes known for the south coast region
[Bolton2012] can be linked to such events. Nevertheless, considering
that the south coast is a ‘hot-spot’ for heatwaves, the fact that
these events are increasing in frequency and knowledge that events
already experienced in the region are already on par with the
intensity and duration of similar events known to have had ecological
effects elsewhere in the world, it is a matter of time before South
Africa experiences a similar marine environmental ‘natural’
disaster.</p>
<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Given that the MHW algorithm is based
on the percentiles found within each time series and not on
arbitrarily decided minimum or maximum thresholds, one will always
find a certain number of MHWs and MCSs in any time series. It is our
experience with these data that every time series used from both
datasets experiences, on average, at least one MHW and MCS per year.
Within each dataset, but not between, the frequency of events is
similar for each coastal section, regardless of the local
oceanographic and geographic properties. Instead, it is the duration,
mean intensity and also the derived cumulative intensity of the
events occurring on the different coastal sections that most clearly
define spatial differences — so much so, that this will almost
certainly translate to different rates of vulnerabilities of coastal
sections, both the ecosystems and the humans that derive benefit from
them, to the ravages of climate change. As the rates of co-occurrence
between local- and broad-scale data are generally low, and the
magnitude and co-occurrence of events within the different datasets
differ from one another, we infer that some other force outside of
mesoscale phenomena is contributing to extreme inshore events. We
think that direct atmospheric forcing of coastal thermal heating is
one such driver that needs immediate research attention in order to
better understand what is driving the occurrence and intensity of
these events.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We have provided a cursory look at an
oceanographic basis for explaining these differences, but we think
that there is an urgent need to consider more carefully the complex
local-scale modifications of broader-scale patterns seen further
afield in order to fully appreciate the drivers of coastal thermal
variability in space and time. That such studies are still lacking in
an age when the pulse of the global ocean is measured with exquisite
precision is a reflection on the oceanographic community’s ongoing
preoccupation with mainly broad-scale patterns and processes.
Globally comprehensive ocean temperatures are made available almost
in real time, but to the best of our knowledge the top coastal
temperature databases are all comprised of records retrieved from
delayed-mode instruments. In the latter case, near-real-time warnings
of the onset and intensity of MHWs (or MCSs) are not yet feasible,
whereas it is already possible to develop and implement such warning
systems using currently-available gridded satellite SST products.
Researchers in the tropics, on coral reefs specifically, are already
doing just this as they implement (near) real-time satellite data for
the monitoring of coral bleaching (e.g.
http://coralreefwatch.NOAA.gov/satellite/index.php). Other coastal
communities should learn from the work of tropical communities in
implementing monitoring systems for extreme temperatures, which is
now becoming relevant as climate change is threatening previously
(relatively) stable ecosystems, such as temperate kelp forests
[Wernberg2013]. We have shown that there is an urgent need for such
warning systems to be implemented, and feel that the need is greatest
for coastal ecosystems as it is here where the effects of MHWs and
MCSs are most intensely seen.</p>
