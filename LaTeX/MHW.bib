abstract = {Historical and recent evidence is documented to demonstrate that the eastern limit of the major kelp-bed forming seaweed \emph{Ecklonia maxima} has moved c. 73 km eastward along the south coast of South Africa since 2006, after remaining unchanged for almost 70 years. A significant population has established at Koppie Alleen, De Hoop Nature Reserve, which has been monitored from 2008 to 2011. It is hypothesised that the eastward spread is limited by aspects of the inshore water temperature regime, and recent evidence suggests that gradual cooling along this coast may have caused the change in distribution. It seems likely that if a cooling trend continues along the South African south coast, kelp beds and their associated species will move farther eastward in future decades, affecting the ecology and livelihoods along this coast.},

abstract = {Biogenic reefs are important for habitat provision and coastal protection. Long-term datasets on the distribution and abundance of Sabellaria alveolata (L.) are available from Britain. The aim of this study was to combine historical records and contemporary data to (1) describe spatiotemporal variation in winter temperatures, (2) document short-term and long-term changes in the distribution and abundance of S. alveolata and discuss these changes in relation to extreme weather events and recent warming, and (3) assess the potential for artificial coastal defense structures to function as habitat for S. alveolata. A semi-quantitative abundance scale (ACFOR) was used to compare broadscale, long-term and interannual abundance of S. alveolata near its range edge in NW Britain. S. alveolata disappeared from the North Wales and Wirral coastlines where it had been abundant prior to the cold winter of 1962/1963. Population declines were also observed following the recent cold winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. Extensive surveys in 2004 and 2012 revealed that S. alveolata had recolonized locations from which it had previously disappeared. Furthermore, it had increased in abundance at many locations, possibly in response to recent warming. S. alveolata was recorded on the majority of artificial coastal defense structures surveyed, suggesting that the proliferation of artificial coastal defense structures along this stretch of coastline may have enabled S. alveolata to spread across stretches of unsuitable natural habitat. Long-term and broadscale contextual monitoring is essential for monitoring responses of organisms to climate change. Historical data and gray literature can be invaluable sources of information. Our results support the theory that Lusitanian species are responding positively to climate warming but also that short-term extreme weather events can have potentially devastating widespread and lasting effects on organisms. Furthermore, the proliferation of coastal defense structures has implications for phylogeography, population genetics, and connectivity of coastal populations.},

abstract = {One of the major concerns with a potential change in climate is that an increase in extreme events will occur. Results of observational studies suggest that in many areas that have been analyzed, changes in total precipitation are amplified at the tails, and changes in some temperature extremes have been observed. Model output has been analyzed that shows changes in extreme events for future climates, such as increases in extreme high temperatures, decreases in extreme low temperatures, and increases in intense precipitation events. In addition, the societal infrastructure is becoming more sensitive to weather and climate extremes, which would be exacerbated by climate change. In wild plants and animals, climate-induced extinctions, distributional and phenological changes, and species' range shifts are being documented at an increasing rate. Several apparently gradual biological changes are linked to responses to extreme weather and climate events.},

abstract = {Chokka squid biomass and catch are highly variable, likely owing to their links to changes in the ecosystem, which impact spawning and recruitment. A synthesis of basic ecosystem components for the domain in which chokka squid live (i.e. South Africa's west coast and Agulhas Bank) was prepared using published and new data. It included bottom temperature, bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and copepod abundance. Alongshore gradients of these indicated that the main spawning grounds on the eastern Agulhas Bank are positioned where bottom temperature and bottom dissolved oxygen are optimal for embryonic development. This location, however, appears suboptimal for hatchlings because the copepod maximum (food for paralarvae) is typically on the central Agulhas Bank some 200 km to the west. Data on currents suggest that this constraint may be overcome by the existence of a net west-flowing shelf current on the eastern Agulhas Bank, improving survivorship of paralarvae by transporting them passively towards the copepod maximum. CTD data and a temporal analysis of AVHRR satellite imagery reveal the copepod maximum to be supported by a "cold ridge", a mesoscale upwelling filament present during summer when squid spawning peaks. \emph{in situ} sea surface temperature (SST) data used as a proxy for cold ridge activity demonstrate considerable interannual variability of the feature, especially during El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation events. Negative linear correlations between maximum summer SST (monthly average) and squid biomass the following autumn (r2 = 0.94), and annual catch (r 2 = 0.69), support the link between the "cold ridge-copepod maximum" and the early life cycle of chokka squid, and holds promise for prediction. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east-west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In austral summer 2011, an unprecedented Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o event occurred off the west coast of Australia, with sea surface temperature anomalies reaching 5. C and significant impacts on marine ecosystems. In this study, a high resolution ({\~{}}2. km) hydrodynamic model (Regional Ocean Modeling System) is used to simulate the variations in the near-surface temperature in the region from 2009 through mid-2011. Model results indicate that the peak temperatures in the broad mid-west coast of Australia during the event are predominantly due to poleward advection of warmer, tropical water (???2/3 contribution). In addition, positive air-sea heat flux into the ocean also contributes (???1/3 contribution) to the rise in temperature. The anomalous advection of warm water is caused by changes in the poleward flowing Leeuwin Current due to both local and remote wind forcing. In early 2011, the Leeuwin Current intensified owing to remote forcing by the equatorial easterly wind anomalies in the Pacific Ocean associated with the 2010-2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a. In addition, the southerly winds off the west coast of Australia weakened, allowing the Leeuwin Current to further intensify in speed at the peak of the event. Concurrently, the inshore, equatorward Capes Current was suppressed and reversed direction. The poleward flow over the shelf contributed to near-shore warming in contrast to cooling by upwelling and equatorward advection from the Capes Current in previous years.},

@article{Perkins2013,
abstract = {Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat- related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum tem- perature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951–2008 and 1971–2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951–2008 than for 1971–2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean mag- nitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

abstract = {Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental \emph{in situ} temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6°C in places between satellite-derived and \emph{in situ} climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the \emph{in situ} temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

abstract = {Observations have revealed the presence of cyclonic eddies embedded in the landward border of the southern Agulhas Current. These shear edge eddies are most prevalent in the Agulhas Bank shelf bight, have a diameter of about 50-100 km and are represented by a thermal dome and a surface warm plume inshore. In an attempt to better understand their generation and behavior, we have used a high-resolution model designed for the general region. The ocean model employed is the Regional Ocean Modeling System that solves the free surface, hydrostatic, primitive equations over variable topography using stretched, terrain-following coordinates in the vertical, orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the horizontal, and featuring high-order schemes. The model simulates the creation of cyclonic shear edge eddies and their attendant surface plumes of warm water along the edge of the Agulhas Bank with a high degree of verisimilitude. The dimensions of the model features, their hydrographic structure and their velocities bear a strong resemblance to what has been observed. The simulation suggests that shear edge eddies remain trapped in the Agulhas Bank shelf bight and that eddies that subsequently travel downstream represent leakages from the resident shear eddy. This intermittent but frequent leakage of cyclonic motion downstream propagates at roughly 8 km day-1 at intervals of roughly 20 days, and may trigger the detachment of a cyclonic eddy at the tip of the Agulhas Bank. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Two or more consecutive drops$\backslash$nand rises can occur at diurnal or semidiurnal periodicities. The$\backslash$ntemperature increases may be accompanied by energetic seaward bottom$\backslash$ncurrents together with sharp-edged warm-water fronts. (Warm-water$\backslash$nfronts are defined here as linear seasurface features dividing parcels$\backslash$nof water of different temperature.)

abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19-34°S), which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the "Bakun triad" of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970-1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz-Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We integrated the emerging information of the ecological, economic and social importance of the coasts at a global scale. We defined coastal regions to range from the continental shelf (to a depth of 200??m), the intertidal areas and adjacent land within 100??km of the coastline. We used the 1??km resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Database and calculated the area covered by 11 different land cover classes (natural and human-altered ecosystems) within the 100??km limit [Burke, L., Kura, Y., Kasem, K., Revenga, C., Spalding, M., McAllister, D., 2001. Coastal Ecosystems. Washington DC World Resource Institute. 93 pp.]. Cover of aquatic ecosystems was calculated based on several world databases. Our results show that the coasts of the world comprise a wide variety of geomorphological characteristics of which mountainous coasts with a narrow shelf are the most abundant. Sandy shores are found on 16{\%} of the coastal countries. The coasts are located in every weather regime and the number of biomes is equally variable. Within the 100??km limit, 72{\%} still is covered by natural ecosystems and 28{\%} have been altered by human activities (urban and croplands). Open shrubs and evergreen broadleaf forests are the most abundant terrestrial ecosystems. Canada has the largest area of natural and relatively well preserved terrestrial ecosystems. Indonesia and China have the largest percentages of cropland area near the shore, and Japan and the US have the largest coastal urban areas. Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Bahamas and New Caledonia have the largest areas of aquatic ecosystems. The calculated economic value of goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems showed that altogether, coastal ecosystems contribute 77{\%} of global ecosystem-services value calculated by Costanza et al. [Costanza, R., d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Naeem, S., Limburg, K., Paruelo, J., O'Neill, R.V., Raskin, R., Sutton, P., ven den Belt, M., 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387, 253-260]. According to 2003 data, 2.385??million people live within the coastal limit, which represents 41{\%} of world global population. More than 50{\%} of the coastal countries have from 80 to 100{\%} of their total population within 100??km of the coastline. Twenty-one of the 33 world's megacities are found on the coast. Multivariate analyses grouped coastal countries according to their ecological, economic and social characteristics. Three gradients explained 55{\%} of the variance: degree of conservation, ecosystem service product and demographic trends. Given the current scenario and the climate change prediction, the coastal environments will be confronting serious environmental issues that should be worked in advance, in order to achieve a sustainable development of the most valued locations of the world.

abstract = {The shallowness of Texas bay waters, their practically landlocked condition and the rapidity with which cold northers strike the coast are factors making the marine life of this area particularly subject to mortality from cold waves every few years. Since 1940 slight mortality was caused by cold waves in 1941 and 1949. Considerable damage was caused in 1947. The 1940 and 1951 episodes were catastrophic. Probably the 1940 instance was the most severe although the 1951 freeze was the hardest. Estimates made by biologists of the Game, Fish and Oyster Commission of the amount of fish killed in 1951 range from 60 million to 90 million pounds. It seems that if the damaging cold waves are preceded by other freezes, their destructive effect is lessened. Some animals escape to deeper water if the onset of the cold wave is slow and the rapidity with which the northers strike is a factor influencing the amount of mortality.},

abstract = {Habitat utilisation by juveniles of 13 commercially important fish species was studied in five habitats located in Chwaka Bay, Zanzibar: mangrove creeks, mangrove channel, sand/mud flats, a seagrass area close to mangroves, and a seagrass area far from mangroves. Fish samples were collected from each habitat using a seine net, and fish abundance and size were measured to determine habitat utilisation. The seagrass beds near to mangroves showed the most diverse fish assemblage of all habitats, possibly because it functions as a corridor between the mangroves and deeper parts of the embayment. Juveniles of Cheilio inermis, Hipposcarus harid, Leptoscarus vaigiensis, and Scolopsis ghanam inhabited seagrass beds only. Juveniles of Gerres filamentosus and Monodactylus argenteus were mainly found in the mangrove habitats. Lethrinus variegatus, Pelates quadrilineatus and Siganus sutor were found in more than two habitats, with highest abundances in seagrass beds. Juveniles of Gerres oyena, Lethrinus lentjan, Lutjanus fulviflamma and Sphyraena barracuda were the most generalist species and were found in all studied embayment habitats. Visual census surveys supported the seine net data showing that most fishes in the embayment habitats were juveniles or sub-adults. In terms of habitat utilisation by different size classes, five of the 13 species (Lethrinus lentjan, L. variegatus, P. quadrilineatus, Siganus sutor and Sphyraena barracuda) were found as small-sized individuals in shallow and turbid mangrove areas, whereas large-sized individuals were observed in deeper and less turbid seagrass beds. A possible explanation for this pattern could be an ontogenetic shift in habitat utilisation, although this could not be proven. The patterns observed in the present study show a high similarity to those observed in marine embayments in the Caribbean, indicating that similar mechanisms are at work which make these systems attractive juvenile habitats.},

abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

abstract = {Periods of elevated temperatures in northern Monterey Bay suggest that this is a region of increased residence time during periods of active upwelling. Nearshore increases in near-surface temperature often coincide with offshore decreases in temperature as cold, upwelled water is advected into the center of the bay-the juxtaposition of warm and cold water enhancing the thermal signature of a feature described as an 'upwelling shadow'. We present a variety of data collected from 1988 to 1993 invoking a shallow, stratified, cyclonic circulation in northern Monterey Bay to explain the upwelling shadow as a dynamic response to upwelling north of the bay. Residence times associated with this warm recirculation are of the order of 8 days which is comparable to semi-enclosed embayments whereas Monterey Bay is an open embayment. We estimate a continuous replacement of upwelling shadow water with offshore water at a rate of 0.083 day-1, and we suggest that a circulation velocity of 0.1 m{\textperiodcentered}s-1, is needed to produce the thermal signature of the feature given published values of surface heat flux in the central California coastal region. The thermal signature of this upwelling shadow persists through much of the upwelling season, surviving brief relaxations in upwelling but breaking down during prolonged relaxations of the order of a week or longer. The stratification and coherent recirculation of this feature is likely to be very important for such biological processes as productivity and the dispersal and recruitment of larvae.},

abstract = {Productive embayments, areas morphometrically sheltered from open lake physical processes, were compared to less productive, exposed shorelines of the nearshore as nursery habitats for larval alewives (\emph{Alosa pseudoharengus}), the principal forage fish in Lake Ontario. Species composition and densities of pelagic larval fishes were assessed with towed plankton nets at three embayments and adjacent nearshore habitats located along the New York shore, two sites in 1997 and a third site in 1998. Peak nearshore densities of larval alewives in 1997 and 1998 were compared to 1977 and 1978, a time period prior to major phosphorus reductions and the establishment of exotic dreissenid mussels in Lake Ontario. Seasonal changes in the pelagic larval fish assemblage were generally similar in the embayments; yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were prevalent in late-May shifting to co-occurrence of alewives and Lepomis spp. in June and July. At all nearshore sites, the larval fish assemblage throughout summer consisted mainly of alewives ({\textgreater} 65{\%}). Densities of larval alewives peaked earlier in embayments but generally at lower densities than observed later in the nearshore. Because the amount of nearshore habitat greatly exceeds that of embayment habitat in Lake Ontario, nearshore waters served as the principal nurseries for larval alewives. However, densities of all larval fish species other than alewives (principally yellow perch and Lepomis spp.) were usually greater in embayments than the nearshore. Compared to three nearshore sites in 1977 and 1978, timing of peak densities of alewives in 1997 and 1998 were similar and temperature dependent; highest densities occurred in late July to early August after nearshore waters were ≥18°C. Peak median nearshore alewife densities (larvae/100 m3) in 1997 (47) and 1998 (60) were similar to those in 1977 (8 to 100) and 1978 (34 to 49). This similarity suggested a limited effect of lowered phosphorus and food web changes on peak larval alewife densities in Lake Ontario.},

abstract = {Irregularities in the shoreline of an embayment act as a trap for water properties such as an introduced pollutant. The exchange of water between the trap and the main body may lead to an effective longitudinal dispersion of these properties. A mathematical model for this problem is developed, in which the exchange process between the trap and main body can be parameterized by the geometry of the system as well as by an exchange rate coefficient. In effect, the trap system behaves as a localized source-and-sink of substance for the main body of water. The model enables us to discuss the moments of the substance distribution. It is shown that, depending upon the values of parameters chosen, the presence of a trap may enhance or suppress the rate of dispersion in the main stream. This study suggests that the entrapment phenomenon may be a process of practical importance in longitudinal dispersion of substance in estuaries and coastal waters. ?? 1973.},

The most severe impacts arise from multi-day heatwaves, associated with warm night-time temperatures and high relative humidity. Here we analyse a set of high-resolution regional climate simulations and show that there is a geographically consistent pattern among climate models: we project the most pronounced changes to occur in southernmost Europe for heatwave frequency and duration, further north for heatwave amplitude and in low-altitude southern European regions for health-related indicators. For the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean region, the frequency of heatwave days is projected to increase from an average of about two days per summer for the period 1961-1990 to around 13 days for 2021-2050 and 40 days for 2071-2100. In terms of health impacts, our projections are most severe for low-altitude river basins in southern Europe and for the Mediterranean coasts, affecting many densely populated urban centres. We find that in these locations, the frequency of dangerous heat conditions also increases significantly faster and more strongly, and that the associated geographical pattern is robust across different models and health indicators.},

abstract = {Two new high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis products have been developed using optimum interpolation (OI). The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use \emph{in situ} data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the \emph{in situ} data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1 degrees OI analyses.The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data (currently available from January 1985 to December 2005) and operational AVHRR data for 2006 onward. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen over operational AVHRR, when available, because Pathfinder agrees better with the \emph{in situ} data. The AMSR AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002. In this product, the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land where AMSR is not available. However, in cloud-free regions, use of both infrared and microwave instruments can reduce systematic biases because their error characteristics are independent.},

Numbers in each major category based on probable circumstances at death were: undetermined, 187; collisions with boats, 87; perinatal/early juvenile with open diagnoses, 58; entrapment in gates of navigation locks and flood-control dams, 35; other human-related causes, 20; natural, 19. Log-linear models were used to test for associations among the variables location, sex, year, season, and cause of death. No significant associations involved more than two variables simultaneously; none involved sex. Significant associations were accounted for largely by increases in numbers of undiagnosed deaths in winter, flood-control dam entrapments in southeastern Florida, and collisions with boats in northeastern Florida, the latter involving a disproportionately large number of adults. High winter mortality occurred in 1977 and 1981. Winter mortality chiefly involved the late juvenile/subadult size class, and numbers of cases showed a negative partial correlation with minimum air temperatures. Some winter deaths may result from metabolic drains on young manatees inexperienced at utilizing thermal refuges. The numbers of human-caused deaths and the projected human population growth in Florida require increased efforts to reduce mortality, provide meaningful sanctuaries, and reach a better understanding of manatee population dynamics and environmental relationships.},

Then we tested how patterns varied in several key metrics of disturbance severity, including anomaly frequency, magnitude, duration and size.Results Our analyses found both global variation in temperature anomalies and fine-grained spatial variability in the frequency, duration and magnitude of temperature anomalies. However, we discovered that even during major climatic events with strong spatial signatures, like the El Ni{\{}{\~{n}}{\}}o2013Southern Oscillation, areas that had high numbers of anomalies varied between years. In addition, we found that 48{\%} of bleaching-related anomalies and 44{\%} of disease-related anomalies were less than 50 km2, much smaller than the resolution of most models used to forecast climate changes.Main conclusions The fine-scale variability in temperature anomalies has several key implications for understanding spatial patterns in coral bleaching- and disease-related anomalies as well as for designing protected areas to conserve coral reefs in a changing climate. Spatial heterogeneity in temperature anomalies suggests that certain reefs could be targeted for protection because they exhibit differences in thermal stress. However, temporal variability in anomalies could complicate efforts to protect reefs, because high anomalies in one year are not necessarily predictive of future patterns of stress. Together, our results suggest that temperature anomalies related to coral bleaching and disease are likely to be highly heterogeneous and could produce more localized impacts of climate change.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in the climate response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are quantified in a perturbed land surface parameter experiment. The ensemble of 108 members is constructed by systematically perturbing five poorly constrained land surface parameters of global climate model individually and in all possible combinations. The land surface parameters induce small uncertainties at global scale, substantial uncertainties at regional and seasonal scale and very large uncertainties in the tails of the distribution, the climate extremes. Climate sensitivity varies across the ensemble mainly due to the perturbation of the snow albedo parameterization, which controls the snow albedo feedback strength. The uncertainty range in the global response is small relative to perturbed physics experiments focusing on atmospheric parameters. However, land surface parameters are revealed to control the response not only of the mean but also of the variability of temperature. Major uncertainties are identified in the response of climate extremes to a doubling of CO2. During winter the response both of temperature mean and daily variability relates to fractional snow cover. Cold extremes over high latitudes warm disproportionately in ensemble members with strong snow albedo feedback and large snow cover reduction. Reduced snow cover leads to more winter warming and stronger variability decrease. As a result uncertainties in mean and variability response line up, with some members showing weak and others very strong warming of the cold tail of the distribution, depending on the snow albedo parametrization. The uncertainty across the ensemble regionally exceeds the CMIP3 multi-model range. Regarding summer hot extremes, the uncertainties are larger than for mean summer warming but smaller than in multi-model experiments. The summer precipitation response to a doubling of CO2 is not robust over many regions. Land surface parameter perturbations and natural variability alter the sign of the response even over subtropical regions.},

The formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in primary production and consequent worldwide coastal eutrophication fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.},

Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of the warming and its underlying dynamical processes is important for improving ecosystem management. Here we show that the warming in the first half of 2012 was systematic from the Gulf of Maine to Cape Hatteras. Moreover, the warm anomalies extended through the water column, and the local temperature change of shelf water in the Middle Atlantic Bight was largely balanced by the atmospheric heat flux. The anomalous atmospheric jet stream position induced smaller heat loss from the ocean and caused a much slower cooling rate in late autumn and early winter of 2011-2012. Strong jet stream intraseasonal oscillations in the first half of 2012 systematically increased the warm anomalies over the continental shelf. Despite the importance of advection in prior Northeast U.S. continental shelf inter-annual temperature anomalies, our analyses show that much of the 2012 warming event was attributed to local warming from the atmosphere.},

Understanding the climatic drivers of this extreme event, which we dub "Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o", is crucial for predicting similar events under the influence of global warming. Here we use observational data and numerical models to demonstrate that the extreme warming was mostly driven by an unseasonable surge of the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current in austral summer, which transported anomalously warm water southward along the coast. The unusual intensification of the Leeuwin Current was forced remotely by oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections associated with the extraordinary 2010-2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a.

Sixty to ninety-eight percent of the corals, depending on the location, were annihilated. Holothurians disappeared from several sites. Other groups, including sand dollars, gastropods, sipunculans, polychaetes and sponges, were decimated, The marine vegetation, mainly composed of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and macroalgae, however, did not show any signs of degradation; neither did the mangrove prop root adherent community. Abnormal levels in several physicochemical parameters were registered in the area, including average water temperatures 10 degreesC lower than usual, reduced concentrations of dissolved oxygen, salinities nearing 5 psu at the bottom-water interface, and lower than normal surficial current speeds due to water slacking. Satellite images show that during the period under study unusual masses of cold water were near the area. The coverage of the affected area was estimated to extend for at least 160 km(2). Although various physicochemical and oceanographical parameters were involved it is likely that low temperatures, probably spurred by a nearby upwelling of cold-water masses, coupled with punctual drops of salinity at some sites, converged to trigger the complex processes that included planktonic blooms and mucilaginous aggregates and finally induced widespread mortalities.},

At the monthly scale, differences of up to 3 1C are detected between the two products in the bay. In the northern half of the bay, SST is fairly well explained by seasonality. In contrast, the southern half exhibits a higher inter-annual variability in SST. The southern half of the bay and the Western Cape upwelling system (Cape Agulhas to Cape Columbine) share most of their variance. Furthermore, the inter-annual variability of SST in False Bay is correlated with both the Nin ˜o 3.4 index and local wind speed anomalies. El Nin ˜o (La Nin ˜a) events induce an equatorward (poleward) shift in the South Atlantic High pressure system leading to a weakening (strengthening) of upwelling favourable south-easterly. Those changes induce a warm (cold) SST anomaly along the West Coast of Southern Africa. {\&}},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

abstract = {Patterns of climate-forced range shift in the marine environment are informed by investigating the population dynamics of an ecologically important sea urchin ( Centrostephanus rodgersii– Diadematidae) across its newly extended range in Tasmania (southeastern Australia). A growth model of C. rodgersii is developed allowing estimation of a sea urchin age profile and, in combination with abundance data, we correlate the sea urchin population dynamic with respect to environmental signals across the range extension region. Growth patterns did not vary across the extension region; however, there was a strong pattern of decreasing sea urchin age with increasing distance from the historic range. The sequential poleward discovery of the sea urchin, a pattern of declining age and a general poleward reduction in abundance along the eastern Tasmanian coastline are consistent with a model of range extension driven by recent change in patterns of larval dispersal. We explore this hypothesis by correlating C. rodgersii population characteristics with respect to the East Australian Current (EAC), i.e. the chief vector for poleward larval dispersal, and reveal patterns of declining sea urchin age and abundance with increasing distance from this oceanic feature. Furthermore, C. rodgersii is generally limited to sites where average winter temperatures are warmer than the cold threshold for its larval development. Potential dispersal and physiological mechanisms defining the range extension appear to be strongly coupled to the EAC which has undergone recent poleward advance and resulted in coastal warming in eastern Tasmania. Predicted climate change conditions for this region will favour continued population expansion of C. rodgersii not only via atmospheric-forced ocean warming, but also via ongoing intensification of the EAC driving continued poleward supply of larvae and heat.

abstract = {Global climate change and invasive species represent two of the biggest threats to the environment. Biological communities are responding to global climate change through poleward shifts in distribution, and changes in abundance and phenology of both native and non-native species. An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events is predicted with global climate change. Much is known about mortality events of marine organisms in relation to warm thermal stress with relatively little known about cold thermal stress, particularly in the tropics. Intertidal species are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in aerial conditions and many are considered indicators of climate change. \emph{Perna viridis} is a recent invader to the United States where it fouls hard substrates and soft sediment habitats. During winter 2007/08, a mortality event was observed for P. viridis across Tampa Bay, Florida. This mortality event coincided with extreme weather conditions when air temperatures dropped below 2 ??C for a period of 6. h during low water. The minimum air temperature recorded was 0.53 ??C. During this period water temperature remained relatively constant ({\~{}}. 20 ??C). We provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that thermal stress relating to exposure to cold air temperatures during emersion was the primary factor underpinning the mortality event. Similar mortality events occurred in 2009 and 2010, also coinciding with prolonged exposure to low air temperatures.In the short term, weather may be responsible for the temporary trimming back of populations at the edge of their geographic range but in the longer-term, it is expected that climate warming will trigger the poleward movement of both native and non-native species potentially facilitating biotic homogenisation of marine communities. The challenge now is to devise adaptive management strategies in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts to native biodiversity. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The formula is confirmed by comparison with residence times predicted by numerical small-scale reef models, including those from a 4 month unsteady current simulation of John Brewer Reef on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The method proves to be a satisfactory alternative to the numerical modelling. When neutrally-buoyant material around a reef is removed by the currents, the concentrations decay exponentially. The decay rate depends primarily on free stream current and reef dimensions. Secondary factors are the tidal excursion, shelf depth, lagoon size and residual current in the lee of the reef. These factors, when combined into a decay coefficient, specify the rate of loss of neutrally-buoyant material (e.g. some larvae, pollutants and sewage) from a coral reef and its surrounds.},

abstract = {Late in summer 2003, extensive mass mortality of at least 25 rocky benthic macro-invertebrate species (mainly gorgonians and sponges) was observed in the entire Northwestern (NW) Mediterranean region, affecting several thousand kilometers of coastline. We were able to characterize the mortality event by studying six areas covering the main regions of the NW Mediterranean basin. The degree of impact on each study area was quantified at 49 sites by estimating the proportion of colonies affected in populations of several gorgonian species compared with reference data obtained in years without mortality signs. According to these data, the western areas (Catalan coast and Balearic Islands) were the least affected, while the central areas (Provence coast and Corsica-Sardinia) showed a moderate impact. The northernmost and eastern areas (Gulf of Genoa and Gulf of Naples) displayed the highest impact, with almost 80{\%} of gorgonian colonies affected. The heat wave of 2003 in Europe caused an anomalous warming of seawater, which reached the highest temperatures ever recorded in the studied regions, between 1 and 3 °C above the climatic values (mean and maximum). Because this exceptional warming was observed in the depth ranges most affected by the mortality, it seems likely that the 2003 anomalous temperature played a key role in the observed mortality event. A correlation analysis between temperature conditions and degree of impact seems to support this hypothesis. Under the present climate warming trend, new mass mortality events may occur in the near future, possibly driving a major biodiversity crisis in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Here, we test the interaction between repeated drought or heavy rainfall events and functional diversity of grassland and heath communities on invasibility, measured as the number of plant individuals invading from the matrix vegetation. Invasibility of experimental plant communities was influenced by extreme weather events, although no change in above-ground productivity of the resident communities was observed. Drought decreased invasibility while heavy rainfall increased invasibility, a pattern that is consistent with the fluctuating resource hypothesis. Higher community diversity generally decreased invasibility, which can be explained by a combination of the fluctuating resource hypothesis and niche theory. The effects of the physical environment (extreme weather events) and diversity resistance (community composition) were additive, as they were independent from each other. Differences in the composition of invading species sets were found, and Indicator Species Analysis revealed several invading species with significant affinity to one particular extreme weather event or community composition. This finding supports niche theory and contradicts neutral species assembly. Our data supports theories which predict decreased resistance of plant communities due to both increased climate variability and biodiversity loss. The effects of these two factors, however, appear to be independent from each other.},

abstract = {It appears that the circulation of False Bay is driven by local wind and tide. While tides may set up a simple oscillatory inflow and outflow, the wind forcing appears to be much more complex. In addition to the spatially heterogeneous wind field, data collected by Wainman et al. (1987) have shown the importance of stratification in late summer. The bay cannot be considered as a single mixed layer. Surface slicks, presumably caused by internal waves, have been observed to propagate far into the bay (e.g. into Simon's Bay). A further aspect of this stratification is the upwelling which has been observed off Cape Hangklip and Gordon's Bay. The apparent action of shelf waves in False Bay is possibly a dominant process in sub-tidal circulation. It is suggested that significant non-linear interaction between these shelf waves, wind-driven flow and tides may account for the intriguing complexity of flow in the bay. On the high-frequency side, wave-driven currents in the shallow northern reaches of the bay cannot be ignored (Shannon et al. 1983, Botes 1988). From the perspective of the water quality of the bay, the most important physical oceanographic processes are the dilution of polluted water and the subsequent exchange of this water with the adjacent open ocean. It is this exchange which ultimately will control the accumulation of pollution in False Bay.},

In early 2011, the marine ecosystems along the west coast of Australia—a global hotspot of biodiversity and endemism4, 5—experienced the highest-magnitude warming event on record. Sea temperatures soared to unprecedented levels and warming anomalies of 2–4 °C persisted for more than ten weeks along {\textgreater}2,000 km of coastline. We show that biodiversity patterns of temperate seaweeds, sessile invertebrates and demersal fish were significantly different after the warming event, which led to a reduction in the abundance of habitat-forming seaweeds and a subsequent shift in community structure towards a depauperate state and a tropicalization of fish communities. We conclude that extreme climatic events are key drivers of biodiversity patterns and that the frequency and intensity of such episodes have major implications for predictive models of species distribution and ecosystem structure, which are largely based on gradual warming trends.},

abstract = {The exceptionally cold period lasting from late December 1962 till early March 1963 affected to varying degrees the whole of the British Isles and much of Europe. Table 1 gives the mean minimum temperatures for a series of representative weather stations (Weather 1963a, b) at or near the west and east coasts of Britain with two more inland stations for comparison. Corrections for altitude have been applied where necessary using the average lapse rate. The mean minimum temperatures followed approximately the normal pattern of winter temperature, values declining from west to east with coastal stations slightly less cold than inland ones. However, the temperature anomalies show that the south, south- west and west coasts experienced minimum temperatures, persisting for 2 months, between 5 and 6 degrees C below the long-term average and so were relatively more severely affected than the east and north-east coasts where the anomaly was only 3-4 degrees C. The extreme north-west was, both absolutely and relatively, the least seriously influenced by the arctic spell. The temperature anomaly, rather than the temperature itself, is likely to be the critical factor determining the impact of the weather, since the balance and constitution of the fauna and flora is likely to be related to the normal temperature pattern for the locality. We should expect to look, therefore, to the south and west coasts for the most obvious consequences of frost damage and particularly to enclosed waters where the temperature is likely to drop most sharply. Fuller details of two such areas are therefore included: the Bristol Channel and the Menai Straits.},

abstract = {Numerous oceanographic processes involved in the transport and survival of larval stages of marine organisms, as well as, in nutrient and phytoplankton delivery, occur in nearshore waters. Yet, while large-scale oceanographic patterns are relatively well known for central Chile, little information exists on temporal and spatial variation in the nearshore environment. In this study, we examined the inner shelf hydrography of two sites in central Chile separated by 15km and with slightly different coastline orientation. Our results show that both sites follow the general oceanographic patterns described for the region, with a well mixed water column and spatial homogeneity in winter months and the onset of a thermocline in spring and through the summer, when upwelling favorable winds intensified. However, despite the proximity of the sites, persistent differences in surface temperature, salinity, stratification, and chlorophyll-a concentration, as well as in the intensity of wind forcing were detected. Time series and cross-correlation analyses between wind and temperature, as well as satellite images, suggest that the intensity and frequency of upwelling varies between these sites, probably due to differences in coastline orientation. The potential existence of a localized upwelling shadow at one site and the influence of riverine input are discussed. The meso-scale oceanographic differences described in this study can have important consequences on the dynamics of nearshore ecosystems and should be born in mind when designing conservation or management strategies. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the coastal ocean off the Northeast U.S., the sea surface temperature (SST) in the first half of 2012 was the highest on the record for the past roughly 150 years of recorded observations. The underlying dynamical processes responsible for this extreme event are examined using a numerical model, and the rel-ative contributions of air-sea heat flux versus lateral ocean advective heat flux are quantified. The model accurately reproduces the observed vertical structure and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the thermo-haline condition of the Gulf of Maine and the Middle Atlantic Bight waters during the anomalous warming period. Analysis of the model results show that the warming event was primarily driven by the anomalous air-sea heat flux, while the smaller contribution by the ocean advection worked against this flux by acting to cool the shelf. The anomalous air-sea heat flux exhibited a shelf-wide coherence, consistent with the shelf-wide warming pattern, while the ocean advective heat flux was dominated by localized, relatively smaller-scale processes. The anomalous cooling due to advection primarily resulted from the along-shelf heat flux divergence in the Gulf of Maine, while in the Middle Atlantic Bight the advective contribution from the along-shelf and cross-shelf heat flux divergences was comparable. The modeling results confirm the conclu-sion of the recent analysis of \emph{in situ} data by Chen et al. (2014a) that the changes in the large-scale atmos-pheric circulation in the winter of 2011–2012 primarily caused the extreme warm anomaly in the spring of 2012. The effect of along-shelf or cross-shelf ocean advection on the warm anomalies from either the Sco-tian Shelf or adjacent continental slope was secondary.},

@article{Sura2011,
abstract = {One of the most important problems in meteorology, physical oceanography, climatology, and related fields is the understanding and dynamical description of multi-scale interactions. Multi-scale interactions are closely related to extreme events in climate and, therefore, of great practical importance. Here an extreme event is defined in terms of the non-Gaussian tail (sometimes also called a weather or climate regime) of the data's probability density function (PDF), as opposed to the definition in extreme value theory, where the statistics of time series maxima (and minima) in a given time interval are studied. The non-Gaussian approach used here allows for a dynamical view of extreme events in weather and climate, going beyond the solely mathematical arguments of extreme value theory. Extreme events are by definition scarce, but they can have a significant impact on people and countries in the affected regions. Understanding extremes has become an important objective in weather/climate variability research because weather and climate risk assessment depends on knowing the tails of PDFs. In recent years, new tools that make use of advanced stochastic theory have evolved to evaluate extreme events and the physics that govern these events. Stochastic methods are ideal to study multi-scale interactions and extreme events because they link vastly different time and spatial scales. One theory attributes extreme anomalies to stochastically forced dynamics, where, to model nonlinear interactions, the strength of the stochastic forcing depends on the flow itself (multiplicative noise). This closure assumption follows naturally from the general form of the equations of motion. Because stochastic theory makes clear and testable predictions about non-Gaussian variability, the multiplicative noise hypothesis can be verified by analyzing the detailed non-Gaussian statistics of atmospheric and oceanic variability. This review paper discusses the theoretical framework, observational evidence, and related developments in stochastic modeling of extreme events in weather and climate. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Examples include SST fluctuations in the Southern Ocean associated with the Southern Annular Mode, a tripolar pattern of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, and a pan-Pacific mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (with additional contributions from oceanic processes). They may also result from coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the tropical Indo-Pacific, the tropical Atlantic Nino, and the cross-equatorial meridional modes ill the tropical Pacific and Atlantic.

Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually strong and persistent weather pattern featuring much higher than normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least the 1980s.

Though many systems have been lost and destroyed, for systems that remain physically intact, there is debate as to whether changing temperatures will result in shifts or collapses. Wernburg et al. show that extreme warming of a temperate kelp forest off Australia resulted not only in its collapse, but also in a shift in community composition that brought about an increase in herbivorous tropical fishes that prevent the reestablishment of kelp. Thus, many systems may not be resilient to the rapid climate change that we face.Science, this issue p. 169Ecosystem reconfigurations arising from climate-driven changes in species distributions are expected to have profound ecological, social, and economic implications. Here we reveal a rapid climate-driven regime shift of Australian temperate reef communities, which lost their defining kelp forests and became dominated by persistent seaweed turfs. After decades of ocean warming, extreme marine heat waves forced a 100-kilometer range contraction of extensive kelp forests and saw temperate species replaced by seaweeds, invertebrates, corals, and fishes characteristic of subtropical and tropical waters. This community-wide tropicalization fundamentally altered key ecological processes, suppressing the recovery of kelp forests.},

They are collected with handheld thermometers or underwater temperature recorders (UTRs) and are recorded at precisions from 0.5° to 0.001°C. Using the natural range of seasonal signals and variability for 84 of these time series, their length, decadal trend, and data precision were systematically varied before fitting generalized least squares (GLS) models to study the effect these variables have on trend detection. The variables that contributed most to accurate trend detection, in decreasing order, were time series length, decadal trend, variance, percentage of missing data (\% NA), and measurement precision. Time series greater than 30 years in length are preferred and although larger decadal trends are modeled more accurately, modeled significance (p value) is largely affected by the variance present. The risk of committing both type-1 and type-2 errors increases when ≥5\% NA is present. There is no appreciable effect on model accuracy between measurement precision of 0.1°–0.001°C. Measurement precisions of 0.5°C require longer time series to give equally accurate model results. The implication is that the thermometer time series in this dataset, and others around the world, must be at least two years longer than their UTR counterparts to be useful for decadal-scale climate change studies. Furthermore, adding older lower-precision UTR data to newer higher-precision UTR data within the same time series will increase their usefulness for this purpose.}
